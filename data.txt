基于修改规则，识别BUG的相关数据：compare_with_rule2.py
Please analyze the following code and identify up to 3 most severe security risks based on this rule:
Instructions:
1. Only identify risks that are directly related to the given rule.
2. Provide a detailed explanation for each identified risk, including the specific lines of code involved.
3. If you find fewer than 3 risks or no risks at all, that's acceptable. Do not force identification of 3 risks if they don't exist.
4. Provide the output in the following JSON format:

Instructions:
1. Only identify a risk if it is directly and clearly related to the given rule.
2. The risk must be highly relevant and certain. If you're not highly confident about the relevance or certainty of a potential risk, do not include it.
3. If no highly relevant and certain risk is found, return an empty list for "risks".
4. If a relevant risk is identified, provide a detailed explanation, including the specific lines of code involved.
5. Provide the output in the following JSON format:
