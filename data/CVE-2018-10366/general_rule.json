    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify Data Access and Reduce Redundant Function Calls\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Replace indirect data access methods or helper functions with direct object property access when the data is already available in the current context.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability by making data sources more explicit\n   - Reduces unnecessary function calls, potentially improving performance\n   - Simplifies the code structure, making it easier to maintain and understand\n   - Decreases the likelihood of errors caused by inconsistent data handling\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for repeated function calls or helper methods used to retrieve data\n   - Check if the data being accessed is already available in the current scope or context\n   - Identify patterns where indirect access methods are used instead of direct property access\n   - Review form handling code, especially areas dealing with pre-filled or default values\n\n4. General Application:\n   This optimization can be applied to various scenarios where data is being accessed indirectly when it's already available in the current context. It's particularly relevant in template engines, form handling, and data display logic across different programming languages and frameworks.\n\n   When applying this rule, ensure that the direct access method doesn't bypass any necessary data processing or validation that the original helper function might have been performing."
