    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security in XML Parsing\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Disable potentially dangerous XML features when parsing XML input.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by preventing XML external entity (XXE) attacks\n   - Reduces vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks\n   - Enhances overall robustness of XML processing\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review all instances of XML parsing in the codebase\n   - Look for XML parser configurations or factory instantiations\n   - Check if security-related properties or features are explicitly set\n   - Pay special attention to code that processes user-supplied XML data\n\n4. General Application:\n   When working with XML parsers or factories:\n   - Disable support for DTDs if not required\n   - Turn off processing of external entities\n   - Explicitly set security-related properties to their safe defaults\n   - Consider using safe parsing modes or configurations provided by the XML processing library\n   - Apply these security enhancements consistently across all XML parsing operations in the project\n\nThis rule can be applied to various XML processing libraries and frameworks across different programming languages to improve security in applications that handle XML data."
