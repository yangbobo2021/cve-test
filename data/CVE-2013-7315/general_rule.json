    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Performance by Configuring External Libraries\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   This change involves configuring an external library (XMLInputFactory) to disable a potentially risky feature.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by preventing potential XML External Entity (XXE) attacks\n   - Reduces unnecessary processing, potentially improving performance\n   - Aligns the application with security best practices\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review usage of external libraries and APIs, especially those handling user input or parsing data\n   - Look for configuration options or properties in these libraries related to security or performance\n   - Check if default settings of libraries align with your security and performance requirements\n   - Consult security guidelines and best practices for the specific libraries or technologies in use\n\n4. General Application:\n   When using external libraries or APIs, always review their default configurations. Many libraries have options to enhance security or performance that are not enabled by default. By carefully configuring these options, you can often improve your application's security posture and efficiency without significant code changes. This principle applies across various programming languages and types of libraries, particularly those involved in data parsing, network communication, or handling user input."
