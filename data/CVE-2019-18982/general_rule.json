    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security Headers for Dynamic Content\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Adding security headers to responses that contain dynamic or user-generated content.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by mitigating potential XSS attacks\n   - Helps prevent malicious script execution from injected content\n   - Enhances overall application security posture\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Look for endpoints that return dynamic HTML content\n   - Review responses that might include user-supplied data\n   - Examine areas where content is rendered directly into the page\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for relevant responses\n   - Use strict CSP rules by default, relaxing only when necessary\n   - Consider applying CSP headers globally and then fine-tuning for specific routes\n   - Regularly audit and update security headers across the application\n   - Combine with other security best practices for a comprehensive approach\n\nNote: While this rule focuses on security headers, always consider the broader security context and potential trade-offs when implementing changes."
