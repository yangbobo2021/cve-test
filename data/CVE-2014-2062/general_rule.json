    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security Checks and Error Handling\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add additional security checks and improve error handling in authentication processes.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases the overall security of the application\n   - Prevents potential information leakage\n   - Improves the robustness of the authentication mechanism\n   - Provides more granular control over user access\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review authentication and authorization code\n   - Look for areas where user input is processed without thorough validation\n   - Identify error-prone sections that lack proper exception handling\n   - Examine code that deals with sensitive information or access control\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement thorough input validation for all user-provided data\n   - Add appropriate exception handling to catch and process various error scenarios\n   - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or responses\n   - Perform additional checks to verify user existence and permissions\n   - Use a \"fail-safe\" approach where access is denied by default unless explicitly granted\n   - Consider implementing logging for security-related events for auditing purposes\n   - Regularly review and update security measures to address new potential vulnerabilities"
