    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security Through Proper Access Control Checks\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add explicit access control checks before performing sensitive operations.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by preventing unauthorized access to data or actions\n   - Reduces the risk of data breaches and malicious activities\n   - Ensures compliance with security best practices and regulations\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review methods that handle user-specific data or actions\n   - Look for operations where the acting user's identity should be verified\n   - Examine areas where data from different users might be accessible\n   - Focus on endpoints or functions that modify or retrieve sensitive information\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms\n   - Add checks to verify that the current user has the necessary permissions\n   - Throw appropriate exceptions or return error responses for unauthorized access attempts\n   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) where applicable\n   - Consistently apply access control checks across all relevant parts of the application\n   - Regularly audit and review access control implementations to ensure completeness and correctness"
