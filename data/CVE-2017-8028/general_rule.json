    "general_rule": "Rule: Ensure Complete State Synchronization After Authentication\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   This optimization ensures that the system's state is fully synchronized\n   and up-to-date after an authentication process.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by enforcing the new authentication state\n   - Prevents potential inconsistencies between the client and server states\n   - Reduces the risk of using stale or incorrect data in subsequent operations\n   - Enhances the overall reliability and correctness of the system\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   Look for authentication or authorization-related code, especially in\n   scenarios where:\n   - The system interacts with external services or resources\n   - There are multiple layers of authentication or security\n   - The code manages sessions or stateful connections\n   - Authentication changes might affect subsequent operations\n\n4. General Application:\n   After applying new authentication credentials or changing security contexts,\n   consider adding a step to refresh or resynchronize the connection or session.\n   This may involve actions such as:\n   - Reconnecting to a service\n   - Refreshing a token\n   - Reloading user permissions\n   - Clearing and rebuilding caches\n   - Resetting connection pools\n\n   The specific implementation will depend on the technology stack and\n   the nature of the system, but the principle of ensuring a fully\n   synchronized state after authentication remains consistent."
