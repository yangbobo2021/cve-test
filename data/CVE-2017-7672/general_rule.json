    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Resource Initialization and Caching\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Move resource-intensive operations out of frequently called methods and into initialization or lazy-loading patterns.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces repeated expensive computations\n   - Improves performance, especially for frequently accessed resources\n   - Decreases memory usage by avoiding unnecessary object creation\n   - Enhances code readability and maintainability\n\n3. How to Identify Opportunities:\n   - Look for expensive operations (e.g., regex compilation, complex string manipulations) inside methods that are called frequently\n   - Identify repeated calculations or object creations that could be done once and reused\n   - Search for static final fields that could be initialized at class load time\n   - Look for getter methods that always return the same value but perform calculations each time\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Move expensive initializations to constructor or static initializer blocks\n   - Use lazy initialization for resources that may not always be needed\n   - Cache results of complex calculations or resource-intensive operations\n   - Utilize final fields for values that don't change after initialization\n   - Implement thread-safe lazy initialization patterns for shared resources in multi-threaded environments\n   - Consider using dependency injection or factory patterns for better resource management\n\nNote: Always profile your application before and after making optimizations to ensure the changes actually improve performance in your specific use case."
