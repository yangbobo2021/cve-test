    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Concurrent Request Handling\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Enhance the handling of concurrent requests by moving the processing of individual requests into separate goroutines or threads.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves overall system responsiveness and throughput\n   - Reduces the risk of blocking on long-running operations\n   - Allows for better utilization of multi-core processors\n   - Enhances scalability of the application\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for loops that process incoming requests sequentially\n   - Identify areas where I/O operations (e.g., network, file) are performed within the main request handling loop\n   - Examine code sections that may benefit from parallel execution\n   - Review server implementations, especially in network-based applications\n\n4. General application:\n   - Implement a concurrent processing model using language-specific constructs (e.g., goroutines in Go, threads in other languages)\n   - Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to manage shared resources\n   - Consider using worker pools or task queues for more controlled concurrency\n   - Ensure proper error handling and resource cleanup in concurrent code\n   - Be mindful of potential race conditions and deadlocks when introducing concurrency"
