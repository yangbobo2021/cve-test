    "general_rule": "Rule: Use Safer and More Efficient Process Execution Methods\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Replace generic process execution functions with more specific and secure alternatives when executing system commands.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved security by reducing the risk of command injection vulnerabilities\n   - Better performance due to reduced overhead in command parsing and execution\n   - Clearer intent and easier maintenance by using more specialized functions\n\n3. How to Identify Opportunities:\n   - Look for instances where shell commands are being constructed as strings\n   - Search for generic process execution functions that accept full command strings\n   - Identify cases where multiple arguments are concatenated into a single string for execution\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use array-based or argument-specific functions for process execution instead of string concatenation\n   - Separate command and arguments to allow the system to handle escaping and quoting\n   - Prefer built-in language or framework functions for common operations rather than executing external commands\n   - When external commands are necessary, use the most specific and secure method available in your language or framework\n   - Review documentation for process execution functions to understand security implications and best practices\n\nThis rule can be applied across various programming languages and environments where system commands or external processes are executed. Always consider the specific security and performance requirements of your project when implementing this optimization."
