    "general_rule": "Rule: Add Conditional Checks to Event Handlers\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   This optimization adds conditional checks within event handler methods to filter out irrelevant events before processing them.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces unnecessary processing of events that don't meet specific criteria\n   - Improves performance by avoiding execution of event-related code for irrelevant events\n   - Enhances code clarity by explicitly defining the conditions under which events should be processed\n   - Prevents potential bugs or unexpected behavior caused by processing events from unintended sources\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for event handler methods or callback functions in the codebase\n   - Check if these handlers process all incoming events without discrimination\n   - Consider whether all events are relevant or if there are specific conditions that determine their importance\n   - Examine the context in which events are generated and received to identify potential filtering criteria\n\n4. General Application:\n   When implementing event-driven systems or callback mechanisms:\n   a. Analyze the source and context of events\n   b. Determine specific conditions that make an event relevant for processing\n   c. Add conditional checks at the beginning of event handler methods\n   d. Only proceed with event processing if the conditions are met\n   e. Consider logging or monitoring filtered events for debugging purposes\n\nBy applying this rule, developers can optimize event-driven code across various projects and programming languages, leading to more efficient and robust software systems."
