    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify and Consolidate Conditional Logic\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Reducing complexity in conditional statements and streamlining decision-making processes.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved readability and maintainability\n   - Reduced cognitive load for developers\n   - Potential performance improvements due to fewer checks\n   - Easier debugging and testing\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for nested if-else statements or switch cases\n   - Identify repeated conditions or checks\n   - Search for complex boolean expressions\n   - Examine error handling and validation logic\n\n4. General application:\n   - Use early returns or guard clauses to handle edge cases\n   - Combine related conditions using logical operators\n   - Extract complex conditions into well-named methods or variables\n   - Utilize polymorphism or strategy pattern to replace conditional logic\n   - Consider using lookup tables or maps for value-based decisions\n   - Implement state machines for complex state-dependent logic\n\nBy applying this rule, developers can create more efficient, readable, and maintainable code across various projects and programming languages. This approach helps in reducing the overall complexity of the codebase and makes it easier for team members to understand and modify the logic when needed."
