    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Proper Data Escaping in Template Rendering\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add escaping to user-generated or dynamic content when rendering it in templates or views.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by preventing potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n   - Ensures proper rendering of special characters in the output\n   - Maintains data integrity and improves the overall robustness of the application\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review all instances where dynamic data is rendered in templates or views\n   - Look for places where user input or database-retrieved content is displayed\n   - Check for the absence of escaping functions or filters in template syntax\n   - Pay special attention to areas where HTML is allowed or expected in the output\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use language-specific or framework-provided escaping functions\n   - Apply escaping consistently across all user-generated or dynamic content\n   - Be cautious when using \"raw\" output options and ensure they are necessary\n   - Consider implementing automatic escaping at the template engine level, if possible\n   - Regularly audit and update escaping practices as part of security reviews"
