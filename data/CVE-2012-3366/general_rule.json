    "general_rule": "Rule: Improve Error Handling and Logging in Subprocess Execution\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   - Replace basic system calls with more robust subprocess management\n   - Enhance error handling and logging for subprocess execution\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increased reliability and stability of the application\n   - Better visibility into subprocess execution results\n   - Improved debugging capabilities\n   - Enhanced security through proper argument escaping\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for direct system command executions (e.g., os.system())\n   - Identify areas where subprocess output is not captured or logged\n   - Search for code that lacks proper error handling for external process execution\n   - Review areas where command arguments are not properly escaped or sanitized\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use built-in subprocess management libraries or modules\n   - Implement proper error handling for all subprocess executions\n   - Capture and log both stdout and stderr from subprocesses\n   - Properly escape or sanitize command-line arguments\n   - Add detailed logging for subprocess execution, including command, arguments, and results\n   - Consider implementing timeouts for long-running subprocesses\n   - Use appropriate permissions and security measures when executing external commands"
