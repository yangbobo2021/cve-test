    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize File System Operations for Symbolic Links\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Enhancing the handling of symbolic links in file system operations, particularly during archive extraction.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by preventing potential path traversal vulnerabilities\n   - Ensures correct resolution of symbolic links within the intended directory structure\n   - Maintains the integrity of the extracted files and their relationships\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for code that deals with archive extraction, especially tar or zip files\n   - Examine file system operations that involve creating or following symbolic links\n   - Review code that handles user-supplied paths or works with potentially untrusted archives\n\n4. General application:\n   When extracting archives or processing file system operations:\n   - Normalize and validate all file paths\n   - Resolve symbolic links relative to their containing directory\n   - Ensure links don't point outside the intended directory structure\n   - Implement checks to prevent path traversal attacks\n   - Consider using built-in security features of extraction libraries when available\n\nThis optimization can be applied to various projects involving file system operations, archive handling, or any scenario where symbolic links might be encountered, regardless of the specific programming language used."
