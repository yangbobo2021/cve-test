    "general_rule": "Rule: Early Return for Special Cases\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   This optimization involves identifying and handling special cases or conditions early in a method, \n   allowing for an early return or exit from the method.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces nesting and improves code readability\n   - Simplifies the main logic flow by separating edge cases\n   - Can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations\n   - Makes the code easier to maintain and modify\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for methods with multiple nested conditions\n   - Identify special cases or error conditions that can be checked early\n   - Search for repeated null checks or type checks throughout a method\n   - Examine methods with complex control flow or multiple return points\n\n4. General application:\n   - Check for special conditions or edge cases at the beginning of the method\n   - Return early or throw exceptions for these cases\n   - Place the main logic of the method after these early checks\n   - Avoid deep nesting of conditional statements\n   - Consider extracting complex conditions into separate methods for better readability\n\nThis rule can be applied to various programming languages and projects to improve code structure,\nreadability, and maintainability. It is particularly useful in methods that handle multiple cases\nor have complex logic flows."
