    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize object creation for frequently used components\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Reuse existing objects instead of creating new ones repeatedly, especially for stateless or immutable components.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces memory allocation and garbage collection overhead\n   - Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary object instantiation\n   - Simplifies code by centralizing object creation and management\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for objects created frequently within loops or methods called often\n   - Identify stateless or immutable objects that can be safely shared\n   - Check for similar objects created with slightly different configurations\n   - Review code for repeated instantiation of utility classes or parsers\n\n4. General application:\n   - Create shared instances as class members or static fields\n   - Use factory methods or dependency injection to provide reusable objects\n   - Consider object pooling for expensive-to-create resources\n   - Implement lazy initialization for objects not always needed\n   - Use builder patterns or fluent interfaces for configurable objects\n   - Refactor code to accept objects as parameters instead of creating them internally\n\nThis optimization can be applied across various programming languages and frameworks, particularly in performance-critical sections of code or applications dealing with high concurrency and resource constraints."
