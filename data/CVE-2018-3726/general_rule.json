    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Input Validation and Output Encoding\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   This change focuses on enhancing security by validating user inputs and properly encoding outputs, particularly in scenarios where user-supplied data is incorporated into the application's response.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents potential security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n   - Improves the overall robustness and reliability of the application\n   - Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior or crashes due to malformed inputs\n   - Enhances the application's compliance with security best practices\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for areas in the code where user input is directly used or displayed\n   - Examine places where dynamic content is generated, especially in web applications\n   - Review code that constructs HTML, SQL queries, or any other output formats\n   - Pay attention to functions that handle file names, URLs, or query parameters\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement input validation routines for all user-supplied data\n   - Use appropriate encoding functions when outputting data, especially in web contexts\n   - Sanitize inputs before using them in sensitive operations or storing in databases\n   - Apply the principle of least privilege when handling user inputs\n   - Utilize language-specific or framework-provided security features for input handling and output encoding\n   - Regularly audit code for potential security vulnerabilities related to input handling"
