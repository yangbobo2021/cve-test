    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Session Management Best Practices\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Enhance security and prevent session-related vulnerabilities by properly managing user sessions, especially during authentication processes.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves overall application security\n   - Reduces the risk of session fixation attacks\n   - Ensures clean state for new user sessions\n   - Prevents potential data leaks between user sessions\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review authentication and session handling code\n   - Look for areas where user sessions are created or modified\n   - Examine login, logout, and session timeout functionality\n   - Analyze code related to session attribute management\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Invalidate existing sessions before creating new ones during authentication\n   - Regenerate session IDs after significant security events (e.g., login, privilege changes)\n   - Implement proper session timeout mechanisms\n   - Clear sensitive session data when no longer needed\n   - Use secure session management libraries or frameworks when available\n   - Regularly audit and update session management code to align with current security best practices\n\nThis rule can be applied across various projects and programming languages to improve session security and management, particularly in web applications and services that handle user authentication."
