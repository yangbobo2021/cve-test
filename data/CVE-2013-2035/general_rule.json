    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify and Consolidate Resource Management\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Streamline resource handling (file operations, I/O streams) by consolidating \n   related operations and using try-with-resources or similar constructs.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability\n   - Reduces the risk of resource leaks\n   - Centralizes error handling and cleanup logic\n   - Potentially improves performance by reducing redundant operations\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for multiple, separate try-catch blocks handling related resources\n   - Identify repeated patterns of resource acquisition and release\n   - Search for manual resource cleanup in finally blocks\n   - Look for scattered error handling logic related to resource management\n\n4. General application:\n   This optimization can be applied to any codebase that deals with system \n   resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections. \n   It's particularly relevant in languages that don't have automatic garbage \n   collection for system resources or in scenarios where timely resource release \n   is critical for performance or correctness."
