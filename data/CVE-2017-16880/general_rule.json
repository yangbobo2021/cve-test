    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security in Data Output Functions\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Strengthen the security of functions that output or display data, especially\n   when dealing with user-supplied or potentially untrusted input.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n   - Improves overall application security\n   - Prevents unintended HTML rendering of malicious input\n   - Maintains data integrity when displaying information\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for functions that return or echo data directly to the user interface\n   - Review methods that handle string manipulation before output\n   - Examine areas where raw data is converted to HTML or other markup\n   - Focus on functions that deal with user input or external data sources\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Always sanitize or escape output that could contain HTML or script tags\n   - Use language-specific functions designed for secure output encoding\n   - Apply context-appropriate escaping (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages,\n     different encoding for JavaScript contexts)\n   - Consider implementing a centralized output sanitization function or using\n     a trusted library for consistent security across the application\n   - Regularly audit and update output handling functions to address new\n     security concerns or best practices"
