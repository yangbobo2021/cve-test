    "general_rule": "Rule: Use Specialized Process Execution Methods for Improved Performance and Security\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Replace generic command execution methods with specialized process execution functions tailored for specific operations.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved performance by using optimized methods for specific tasks\n   - Enhanced security by reducing the risk of command injection vulnerabilities\n   - Better error handling and logging capabilities\n   - Increased code readability and maintainability\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Look for instances where shell commands are executed using generic methods (e.g., exec, spawn, or system calls)\n   - Identify repetitive patterns of command execution, especially for common operations like file system manipulation or version control commands\n   - Review areas of the code that deal with external process execution or system-level operations\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Create or utilize specialized functions or libraries for common operations (e.g., file system operations, network requests, or version control commands)\n   - Implement wrappers around low-level process execution methods to provide a more secure and controlled interface\n   - Standardize the approach to external process execution across the project\n   - Consider using language-specific libraries or modules that offer safer alternatives to shell command execution"
