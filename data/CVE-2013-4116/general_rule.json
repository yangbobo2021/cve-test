    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Uniqueness and Randomness in Temporary Resource Naming\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Replacing simple timestamp or process ID-based naming with a more robust \n   randomized approach for temporary resources (e.g. folders, files, IDs).\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces the likelihood of naming collisions in multi-process environments\n   - Improves security by making resource names less predictable\n   - Maintains uniqueness across system restarts or clock changes\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for places where temporary resources are named using only timestamps, \n     process IDs, or incremental counters\n   - Check for code that generates identifiers for concurrent operations\n   - Review areas dealing with file system operations, especially in temp directories\n   - Examine database operations creating temporary tables or entries\n\n4. General application:\n   This principle can be applied in various contexts where unique, non-guessable \n   identifiers are needed, such as:\n   - Generating session IDs\n   - Creating temporary file or directory names\n   - Assigning unique identifiers in distributed systems\n   - Producing one-time tokens for security operations\n\nWhen implementing this rule, consider using language-specific secure random \nnumber generators or cryptographic functions to ensure high-quality randomness.\nAlways balance the length and complexity of the generated names with the \nspecific requirements of your system."
