    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security in XML Parsing\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Configuring XML parsers to prevent common security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Protects against XML external entity (XXE) attacks\n   - Reduces the risk of denial-of-service attacks\n   - Improves overall application security\n   - Follows security best practices for XML processing\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Review all instances of XML parsing in the codebase\n   - Look for XML parser configurations that don't explicitly disable external entities\n   - Check for use of default parser settings without security considerations\n   - Examine XML-related libraries and ensure they're configured securely\n\n4. General application:\n   - Apply secure XML parsing configurations across all XML processing code\n   - Update XML parsing libraries to versions that support secure defaults\n   - Create a centralized XML parsing utility that enforces secure configurations\n   - Implement security checks in code review processes for XML-related changes\n   - Educate development teams about XML security best practices"
