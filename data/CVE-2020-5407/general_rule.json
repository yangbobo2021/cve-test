    "general_rule": "Rule: Consolidate and Streamline Validation Logic\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Consolidation of multiple validation steps into a single, comprehensive validation process.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability\n   - Reduces duplication of validation logic\n   - Centralizes error handling and reporting\n   - Potentially improves performance by reducing redundant checks\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for multiple, scattered validation checks throughout a codebase\n   - Identify repeated error handling or exception throwing patterns\n   - Search for similar validation logic applied to different objects or data structures\n   - Examine methods with numerous conditional statements or early returns\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Create a dedicated validation method or class to handle all aspects of validation\n   - Use a collection to store and manage validation errors\n   - Implement a consistent error reporting mechanism\n   - Consider using a validation context object to pass necessary information\n   - Utilize appropriate design patterns (e.g., Chain of Responsibility, Specification) for complex validation scenarios\n   - Ensure that the consolidated validation logic is flexible and extensible for future requirements"
