    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Error Message Clarity and Localization\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Replace hardcoded error messages with localized, configurable messages from resource bundles.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves user experience by providing clearer, more consistent error messages\n   - Enables easy localization and customization of error messages\n   - Centralizes error message management, making updates easier\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for hardcoded string literals used for error or status messages\n   - Check for repeated error messages across different parts of the codebase\n   - Identify areas where error messages might need to be displayed in multiple languages\n\n4. General implementation:\n   - Create resource bundles for error messages\n   - Use a message retrieval mechanism (e.g., ResourceBundle class in Java)\n   - Replace hardcoded strings with keys that reference messages in the resource bundle\n   - Implement a fallback mechanism for missing messages\n   - Consider parameterizing messages for dynamic content\n\nThis rule can be applied to various projects and languages that support resource bundles or similar localization mechanisms. It promotes better code organization, easier maintenance, and improved user experience across different locales."
