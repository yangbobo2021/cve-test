    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security in User-Generated Content Processing\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Disable potentially dangerous features when processing user-generated content.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by reducing attack vectors\n   - Prevents unauthorized access to system resources\n   - Mitigates risks associated with malicious user input\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review code that processes or renders user-supplied content\n   - Look for libraries or functions that parse markup languages\n   - Examine configuration options for content processing modules\n   - Identify areas where external resources can be referenced or embedded\n\n4. General Application:\n   When working with user-generated content or external data sources:\n   - Disable features that allow execution of arbitrary code\n   - Prevent inclusion of external files or resources\n   - Limit the ability to access or modify system files\n   - Restrict the use of potentially harmful HTML tags or attributes\n   - Apply strict input validation and sanitization\n   - Use safe defaults and explicitly enable only necessary features\n   - Regularly review and update security settings for third-party libraries\n\nBy following this rule, developers can enhance the security of their applications across various projects and programming languages, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities related to user-generated content processing."
