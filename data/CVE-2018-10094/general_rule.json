    "general_rule": "Rule: Consolidate Redundant Database Queries\n\n1. Type of improvement: \nReducing the number of redundant or repetitive database queries by consolidating them into a single, more efficient query.\n\n2. Benefits:\n- Improves performance by reducing database load\n- Simplifies code by removing duplicate logic\n- Makes the code more maintainable by centralizing data retrieval\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n- Look for repeated database queries within loops\n- Check for multiple queries fetching related data that could be combined\n- Identify places where similar data is being retrieved in different parts of the code\n\n4. General application:\nThis principle can be applied in any codebase that interacts with a database, regardless of programming language or framework. It involves analyzing data access patterns and restructuring queries to retrieve all necessary data efficiently in fewer operations."
