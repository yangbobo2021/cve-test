    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Reliability in Authentication Flows\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Strengthening the security and reliability of authentication mechanisms, \n   particularly in handling tokens and redirects.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases protection against potential security vulnerabilities\n   - Improves the robustness of the authentication process\n   - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access or tampering\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review all areas of code handling user authentication and authorization\n   - Look for instances where user-supplied data is used in security-critical operations\n   - Examine token generation, validation, and storage processes\n   - Assess how redirects and callback URLs are managed\n   - Evaluate error handling and logging in authentication flows\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement additional validation checks for all security-related data\n   - Use cryptographic signing for sensitive data that needs to be passed through the client\n   - Ensure all tokens and security-critical information are properly encrypted and validated\n   - Implement strict typing and input validation for all authentication-related functions\n   - Use secure, HttpOnly cookies for storing authentication tokens\n   - Implement proper error handling and logging for authentication failures\n   - Regularly review and update authentication libraries and dependencies"
