    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Cross-Context Object Marshaling\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Optimizing the process of marshaling objects between different execution contexts or script environments.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves performance by reducing unnecessary object copying and conversion\n   - Enhances security by ensuring proper isolation between contexts\n   - Increases code maintainability by centralizing cross-context logic\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for systems that involve multiple execution contexts or scripting environments\n   - Identify areas where objects are frequently passed between contexts\n   - Search for redundant type checking or conversion operations\n   - Examine code that deals with security boundaries or isolation between components\n\n4. General approach:\n   - Implement a centralized marshaling system to handle cross-context object transfers\n   - Use type-specific marshaling logic to optimize for different object types\n   - Implement caching mechanisms to avoid redundant marshaling of the same objects\n   - Ensure proper handling of object prototypes and inheritance chains\n   - Add security checks and validations during the marshaling process\n   - Optimize for common cases while still handling edge cases correctly\n   - Consider implementing lazy marshaling to defer expensive operations until necessary"
