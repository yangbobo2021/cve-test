    "general_rule": "Rule: Improve File System Operations Safety and Efficiency\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   - Replace hard-coded temporary directories with system-provided temporary locations\n   - Use secure file creation methods for temporary files\n   - Implement proper file cleanup and management\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by using system-designated temporary locations\n   - Reduces the risk of file conflicts and permission issues\n   - Improves cross-platform compatibility\n   - Ensures better resource management and cleanup\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for hard-coded file paths, especially those using \"/tmp\" or similar\n   - Search for manual file creation and management in temporary locations\n   - Identify areas where temporary files are created without proper cleanup mechanisms\n   - Review code that performs file system operations, particularly for temporary or intermediate files\n\n4. General application:\n   - Use language or framework-provided methods for creating and managing temporary files and directories\n   - Implement proper error handling and cleanup for file operations\n   - Avoid hard-coding file paths, especially for temporary storage\n   - Utilize context managers or similar constructs to ensure proper resource cleanup\n   - Consider the security implications of file operations, particularly in shared environments"
