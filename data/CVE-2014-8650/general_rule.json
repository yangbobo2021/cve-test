    "general_rule": "Rule: Recursive Error Handling\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   The improvement involves modifying error handling to recursively process responses until a non-error state is reached or all options are exhausted.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases robustness by handling multiple layers of authentication or error responses\n   - Reduces code duplication by centralizing error handling logic\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability by simplifying the main flow\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   Look for error handling code that:\n   - Deals with multiple potential error states or authentication layers\n   - Contains similar logic repeated in different methods or functions\n   - Might benefit from a more comprehensive, recursive approach to processing responses or errors\n\n4. General application:\n   When dealing with complex error handling or multi-step processes:\n   - Implement a recursive function that can handle various response types\n   - Use this function to process responses and errors until a final state is reached\n   - Centralize the logic for different response types within this recursive function\n   - Ensure proper exit conditions to prevent infinite recursion\n\nThis pattern can be applied in various scenarios, such as API communication, authentication flows, or any multi-step process where each step may require different handling based on the response."
