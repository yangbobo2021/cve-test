    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Regular Expressions for Improved Performance and Accuracy\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Refine and tighten regular expressions to be more specific and efficient.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved performance: More precise regex patterns can be processed faster.\n   - Enhanced accuracy: Tighter constraints reduce false positives and negatives.\n   - Better maintainability: Clearer, more focused patterns are easier to understand and modify.\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Review existing regular expressions, especially those used frequently or for critical validations.\n   - Look for overly broad patterns that may allow invalid inputs.\n   - Identify complex regex patterns that could be simplified or split into multiple checks.\n   - Pay attention to performance bottlenecks related to string matching or validation.\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Analyze the specific requirements for each pattern and ensure the regex accurately reflects these needs.\n   - Use appropriate quantifiers and character classes to tighten pattern matching.\n   - Consider breaking complex patterns into smaller, more manageable parts when possible.\n   - Test refined patterns thoroughly to ensure they maintain correct functionality while improving performance.\n   - Keep regular expressions as simple as possible while still meeting all requirements.\n   - Document the purpose and constraints of each regex pattern for future maintenance.\n\nBy applying this rule, developers can enhance the efficiency and reliability of string matching and validation across various projects and programming languages that utilize regular expressions."
