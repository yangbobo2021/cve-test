    "general_rule": "Rule: Use Native DOM Methods Instead of Library Wrappers\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Replace library-specific selector methods with native DOM API methods when possible.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces dependency on external libraries\n   - Improves performance by eliminating unnecessary abstraction layers\n   - Increases code portability and maintainability\n   - Reduces overall bundle size when library methods are not needed\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for library-specific selector methods or utility functions\n   - Check if there are equivalent native DOM API methods available\n   - Assess if the library method is providing significant additional functionality\n   - Consider the trade-off between code brevity and performance\n\n4. General applicability:\n   This rule can be applied to various front-end projects using DOM manipulation libraries. While the specific implementation may vary depending on the programming language and framework, the principle of preferring native methods over library wrappers remains consistent across different environments."
