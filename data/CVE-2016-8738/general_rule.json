    "general_rule": "Rule: Trim Input Before Validation\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Preprocessing user input before applying validation rules.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves accuracy of validation by removing leading/trailing whitespace\n   - Reduces false negatives in validation checks\n   - Enhances user experience by being more forgiving of minor input errors\n   - Potentially prevents security vulnerabilities caused by unintended whitespace\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Look for validation functions or methods that process user input\n   - Check for string comparisons or pattern matching operations\n   - Review areas where user-supplied data is checked against predefined formats or rules\n   - Examine input sanitization routines\n\n4. General Application:\n   Before applying any validation logic to user-supplied string input:\n   a. Check if the input is null or empty\n   b. If not, trim any leading or trailing whitespace\n   c. Proceed with the actual validation on the trimmed input\n\nThis rule can be applied across various programming languages and projects\nwhere user input validation is performed, improving both the robustness\nand user-friendliness of the application."
