    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Proper Access Control\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Adding access control checks to sensitive operations or data access points.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to critical functionalities\n   - Reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized modifications\n   - Ensures compliance with security best practices and regulations\n   - Helps maintain the integrity of the system\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review entry points to sensitive operations or data access\n   - Look for public methods or endpoints that handle critical functionalities\n   - Examine areas where user input is processed or where system-level changes occur\n   - Consider operations that involve file system access, database modifications, or administrative tasks\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or permission checks before executing sensitive operations\n   - Use authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by the framework or language\n   - Apply the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions for each operation\n   - Regularly audit and review access control implementations to ensure they remain effective and up-to-date"
