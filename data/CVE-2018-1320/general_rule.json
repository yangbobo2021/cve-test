    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify Complex Control Flow\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Reduce nested conditional statements and simplify complex control flow structures.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability\n   - Reduces cognitive load for developers\n   - Potentially improves performance by reducing branching\n   - Decreases the likelihood of bugs in complex logic\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for methods with multiple levels of nested if-else statements\n   - Identify loops with complex termination conditions or multiple break points\n   - Search for switch statements with numerous cases and fall-through logic\n   - Spot methods with high cyclomatic complexity\n\n4. General approach:\n   - Use early returns to handle edge cases or preconditions\n   - Employ guard clauses to reduce nesting\n   - Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean methods\n   - Consider using state machines or lookup tables for complex branching logic\n   - Refactor large methods into smaller, more focused functions\n   - Utilize polymorphism or the strategy pattern to replace complex conditional logic\n   - Apply the \"Single Responsibility Principle\" to break down complex methods\n\nThis rule can be applied across various programming languages and projects to improve code quality, maintainability, and potentially performance."
