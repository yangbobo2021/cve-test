    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance XML Parsing Security\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Implement security measures in XML parsing to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by mitigating potential vulnerabilities\n   - Reduces the risk of malicious data exploitation\n   - Enhances overall system robustness and reliability\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review all instances of XML parsing in the codebase\n   - Look for XML processing libraries or built-in XML parsers\n   - Check for default configurations that might allow external entity resolution\n   - Examine areas where user-supplied or network-sourced XML data is processed\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Disable DTD (Document Type Definition) processing\n   - Turn off external entity resolution\n   - Disable XML inclusion (XInclude) features\n   - Set entity expansion limits\n   - Use safe defaults for XML parsers and processors\n   - Apply these security measures consistently across all XML parsing operations\n\nNote: While this rule focuses on XML parsing, similar principles can be applied to other data parsing and processing tasks to enhance overall application security."
