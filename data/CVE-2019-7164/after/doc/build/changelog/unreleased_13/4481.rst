   Fully removed the behavior of strings passed directly as components of a
   :func:`.select` or :class:`.Query` object being coerced to :func:`.text`
   constructs automatically; the warning that has been emitted is now an
   ArgumentError or in the case of order_by() / group_by() a CompileError.
   This has emitted a warning since version 1.0 however its presence continues
   to create concerns for the potential of mis-use of this behavior.

   Note that public CVEs have been posted for order_by() / group_by() which
   are resolved by this commit:  CVE-2019-7164  CVE-2019-7548
