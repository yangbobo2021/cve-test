    Fixed issue where using an uppercase name for an index type (e.g. GIST,
    BTREE, etc. ) or an EXCLUDE constraint would treat it as an identifier to
    be quoted, rather than rendering it as is. The new behavior converts these
    types to lowercase and ensures they contain only valid SQL characters.
