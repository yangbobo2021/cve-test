    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Performance by Extracting and Configuring Reusable Components\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Extraction of a frequently used component (document builder creation) into a separate method with additional security configurations.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code maintainability by centralizing the creation and configuration of a complex object\n   - Enhances security by applying consistent security settings to prevent XML-based attacks\n   - Potentially improves performance by allowing for reuse of the configured object\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for repeated instantiation and configuration of complex objects throughout the codebase\n   - Identify areas where security configurations are missing or inconsistently applied\n   - Search for code that deals with parsing or processing of external data, especially in XML or similar formats\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Extract the creation and configuration of complex objects into separate, reusable methods\n   - Apply relevant security settings to prevent common vulnerabilities\n   - Ensure consistent application of security measures across the entire codebase\n   - Consider making the extracted method private if it's only used within the class, or protected/public if it can be reused in other parts of the project\n   - Document the purpose of the extracted method and any security considerations for future developers\n\nThis rule can be applied to various projects and languages where object creation, configuration, and security are concerns, particularly in systems that process external data or deal with potentially untrusted inputs."
