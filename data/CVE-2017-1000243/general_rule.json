    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify and Streamline Authentication Handling\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Reduce complexity in user authentication and identification processes.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability\n   - Reduces potential for errors in user identification\n   - Eliminates redundant code and unnecessary parameters\n   - Leverages built-in framework features for consistent behavior\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for methods that manually handle user authentication or identification\n   - Search for redundant parameters that can be obtained from the current context\n   - Identify areas where framework-provided utilities can replace custom logic\n   - Review code for repeated checks of user status or permissions\n\n4. General Application:\n   When dealing with user authentication and identification:\n   a. Utilize framework-provided methods to obtain the current user\n   b. Remove unnecessary parameters if the information can be derived from the context\n   c. Centralize user-related checks and validations\n   d. Prefer built-in security features over custom implementations\n   e. Ensure consistent handling of authentication across the application\n\nThis rule can be applied to various projects and languages where user authentication \nand identification are common, especially in web applications and services."
