    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Permission Checks for Sensitive Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Adding security checks to restrict access to sensitive information or operations.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances application security by preventing unauthorized access\n   - Reduces the risk of data breaches and misuse of sensitive information\n   - Ensures compliance with privacy regulations and best practices\n   - Improves overall system integrity and user trust\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review methods that return or manipulate sensitive data (e.g., personal information, device identifiers)\n   - Look for public APIs or interfaces that lack permission checks\n   - Analyze data flow to identify points where sensitive information is accessed or transmitted\n   - Consider operations that could potentially impact system stability or user privacy\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement appropriate permission checks before executing sensitive operations\n   - Use platform-specific or custom permission systems to manage access control\n   - Log and handle unauthorized access attempts\n   - Regularly audit and update permission requirements as the application evolves\n   - Consider implementing different levels of permissions for various user roles or contexts\n   - Ensure that permission checks are consistent across related operations and modules"
