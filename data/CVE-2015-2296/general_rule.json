    "general_rule": "Rule: Consolidate Redundant Logic\n\n1. Type of improvement: \n   Removing duplicate or nearly identical code blocks and consolidating them into a single reusable function or method.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces code duplication and overall codebase size\n   - Improves maintainability by centralizing logic in one place\n   - Reduces the chance of inconsistencies when logic needs to be updated\n   - Can improve performance by avoiding redundant computations\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for code blocks with very similar structure or logic repeated in multiple places\n   - Pay attention to methods or functions that differ only slightly in their parameters or return values\n   - Search for copy-pasted code segments throughout the project\n   - Review large classes or modules for internal repetition\n\n4. General applicability:\n   This principle can be applied across various programming languages and project types. It aligns with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of software development. While the specific implementation may vary, the core concept of consolidating redundant logic is universally beneficial for code quality and maintainability."
