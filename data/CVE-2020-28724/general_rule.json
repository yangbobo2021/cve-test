    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify and consolidate redundant or overly complex code paths\n\n1. Type of improvement: \n   Removing unnecessary complexity and duplication in code logic\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability \n   - Reduces potential for bugs by eliminating redundant code\n   - Can improve performance by streamlining execution paths\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for repeated similar code blocks or logic\n   - Examine complex conditional statements or nested loops\n   - Review error handling and edge cases for consolidation\n   - Analyze function parameters and return values for simplification\n\n4. General applicability:\n   This principle can be applied across many types of projects and languages. \n   Focus on identifying core logic and streamlining how it's implemented,\n   rather than prematurely optimizing or over-engineering solutions. The \n   goal is clean, maintainable code that clearly expresses its intent."
