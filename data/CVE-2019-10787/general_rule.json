    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Input Validation for Security\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Adding input validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by preventing malicious input from being processed\n   - Reduces the risk of command injection attacks\n   - Improves overall robustness of the application\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for functions that process user input or external data\n   - Examine areas where data is used to construct commands or queries\n   - Review code that interacts with system resources or executes external commands\n   - Identify places where unvalidated input is passed to sensitive operations\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement input validation checks before processing any external data\n   - Use regular expressions or validation libraries to check for suspicious characters\n   - Sanitize input by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters\n   - Apply the principle of least privilege when executing commands or accessing resources\n   - Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements for database operations\n   - Implement proper error handling and logging for validation failures\n   - Regularly review and update validation rules to address new security threats"
