    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Consistent and Comprehensive Security Checks\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Enhanced security measures by adding consistent CSRF token validation across different actions and request methods.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves overall application security by preventing cross-site request forgery attacks\n   - Ensures that all sensitive operations are protected, regardless of the request method\n   - Reduces the risk of unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of authenticated users\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Review all forms and actions that modify data or perform sensitive operations\n   - Look for inconsistencies in security checks across different parts of the application\n   - Examine both GET and POST requests for proper security validation\n   - Check for missing or incomplete CSRF protection on important actions\n\n4. General application:\n   - Implement a standardized method for generating and validating CSRF tokens\n   - Apply CSRF protection to all state-changing operations, not just form submissions\n   - Use a centralized security check mechanism that can be easily applied to multiple endpoints\n   - Ensure that security checks are performed before executing any sensitive operations\n   - Regularly audit the codebase to identify and protect any newly added features or endpoints"
