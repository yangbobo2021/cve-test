    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Adding security measures to protect against CSRF attacks in web applications.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances application security by preventing unauthorized actions\n   - Protects users from malicious exploits\n   - Improves overall system integrity and trustworthiness\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for form submissions or state-changing GET requests\n   - Examine actions that modify data or perform sensitive operations\n   - Review authentication and session management code\n   - Analyze server-side logic that processes user requests\n\n4. General implementation approach:\n   - Generate and store a unique token for each user session\n   - Include the token in forms or URLs for state-changing operations\n   - Validate the token on the server-side before processing the request\n   - Regenerate the token after each valid request\n   - Implement token checks consistently across all relevant parts of the application\n\nThis rule can be applied to various web applications, regardless of the specific programming language or framework used. It addresses a common security vulnerability and should be considered a best practice in web development."
