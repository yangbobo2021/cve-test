    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security of Cached Data\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Implement stricter security measures for cached data files, including user-specific file naming and permissions checks.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive cached data\n   - Reduces the risk of cache poisoning attacks\n   - Improves overall system security\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   Look for instances where:\n   - Data is cached to disk\n   - Cache files are shared between users or processes\n   - File permissions are not explicitly set or checked\n   - Cache file names do not include user-specific information\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Include user-specific identifiers (e.g., user ID) in cache file names\n   - Set restrictive file permissions when creating cache files\n   - Verify file ownership and permissions before reading from cache files\n   - Use secure temporary file creation methods\n   - Implement periodic cache cleanup to remove outdated or potentially compromised files"
