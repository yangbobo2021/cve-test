    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security Through Improved Entropy in Token Generation\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Increase the complexity and uniqueness of generated tokens by incorporating additional entropy sources into the token generation process.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by making tokens more resistant to guessing or brute-force attacks\n   - Reduces the likelihood of token collisions\n   - Improves the overall robustness of the authentication or verification system\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for functions or methods that generate tokens, hashes, or unique identifiers\n   - Examine the inputs used in these generation processes\n   - Identify opportunities to include additional unique or time-varying data in the generation algorithm\n   - Consider incorporating more elements that change with each token generation, such as timestamps or sequence numbers\n\n4. General Application:\n   When generating tokens or unique identifiers, strive to include multiple sources of entropy. This can include:\n   - Timestamps or time-based data\n   - Unique request-specific information\n   - System-specific identifiers\n   - User-specific data (when appropriate and not compromising privacy)\n   - Sequence numbers or counters\n\n   Combine these elements in a way that maximizes uniqueness and unpredictability, typically using cryptographic hash functions or similar mechanisms designed for security purposes.\n\nRemember to balance the need for increased entropy with performance considerations and avoid including sensitive information in token generation unless absolutely necessary and properly secured."
