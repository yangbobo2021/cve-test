    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Error Handling and Logging\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Improve error handling by providing more informative error messages and \n   enhancing logging of exceptions.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Easier debugging and troubleshooting\n   - Improved system stability and reliability\n   - Better visibility into runtime issues\n   - Enhanced ability to diagnose and fix problems\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for catch blocks that swallow exceptions or provide minimal information\n   - Review error messages for clarity and usefulness\n   - Examine logging statements for completeness\n   - Identify areas where additional context would be helpful for debugging\n\n4. General application:\n   - Wrap raw exception messages with additional context\n   - Use consistent error reporting and logging patterns\n   - Include relevant state information when logging errors\n   - Consider using structured logging for machine-parseable error data\n   - Implement appropriate levels of logging (debug, info, warn, error)\n   - Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in error messages or logs"
