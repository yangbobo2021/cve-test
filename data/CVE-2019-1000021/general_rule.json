    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify and Standardize Configuration Settings\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Streamline configuration settings by removing unnecessary options and standardizing the remaining ones.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces complexity and potential for errors\n   - Improves code maintainability\n   - Enhances consistency across the codebase\n   - May lead to better performance due to simplified logic\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for configuration dictionaries, objects, or files with multiple options\n   - Identify rarely used or redundant settings\n   - Search for configuration options that have become obsolete due to changes in requirements or dependencies\n   - Review configuration settings for consistency with current best practices or standards in the field\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Analyze the usage of each configuration option throughout the codebase\n   - Remove options that are no longer necessary or have been superseded by other features\n   - Consolidate similar options into more generalized settings\n   - Update related code to work with the simplified configuration\n   - Ensure that the new configuration still meets all current requirements\n   - Document any changes in configuration options for users and developers"
