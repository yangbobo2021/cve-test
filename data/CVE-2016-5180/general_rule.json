    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Memory Allocation and Bounds Checking\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   - Allocate memory based on maximum possible size instead of calculating exact size\n   - Perform bounds checking earlier in the process\n   - Combine multiple checks into a single validation step\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces the number of memory allocations and potential reallocations\n   - Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations\n   - Enhances security by validating input earlier in the process\n   - Simplifies code structure and improves readability\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for functions that perform multiple memory allocations or reallocations\n   - Identify areas where input validation is scattered throughout the function\n   - Search for repeated calculations or checks that can be consolidated\n   - Examine functions that process variable-length data or strings\n\n4. General application:\n   - Allocate memory for the worst-case scenario when dealing with variable-length data\n   - Perform input validation and bounds checking as early as possible in the function\n   - Combine related checks into a single validation step when appropriate\n   - Use early returns or exits for invalid inputs to simplify control flow\n   - Consider trade-offs between memory usage and performance based on the specific use case"
