    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security by Disabling Potentially Dangerous Features\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Disabling external entity loading and suppressing XML parsing errors in XML processing.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks\n   - Reduces the risk of information disclosure through error messages\n   - Enhances the overall robustness of the application\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for XML parsing functions or libraries in the codebase\n   - Check for configuration options related to external entities or error handling\n   - Review input validation and processing of user-supplied data, especially in formats like XML, JSON, or YAML\n   - Examine error handling and logging mechanisms for sensitive operations\n\n4. General application:\n   When working with parsers, serializers, or any component that processes structured data:\n   - Disable features that could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as external entity loading\n   - Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information\n   - Use safe defaults and explicitly enable only required features\n   - Keep libraries and dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches\n   - Follow the principle of least privilege by restricting access and functionality to the minimum necessary"
