    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Error Handling and Validation\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Add specific error handling for unexpected or invalid input data.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code robustness and reliability\n   - Provides more informative error messages for debugging\n   - Prevents silent failures or unexpected behavior\n   - Enhances the overall stability of the system\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for switch statements or conditional blocks that handle different data types or values\n   - Examine functions that process or parse input data\n   - Review error-prone areas of code, especially those dealing with external data or user input\n   - Identify default or catch-all cases that might mask specific errors\n\n4. General application:\n   Instead of using a default case that silently ignores unexpected input, throw a specific exception or error with a descriptive message. This approach helps in quickly identifying and addressing issues during development and maintenance phases.\n\n   This rule can be applied to various programming languages and projects, especially those dealing with data processing, parsing, or handling multiple input types. It's particularly useful in libraries, APIs, and systems that need to maintain strict data integrity and provide clear feedback on errors."
