    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Logging and Error Reporting\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Improve the quality and informativeness of log messages and error reports.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Easier troubleshooting and debugging\n   - Better visibility into system behavior\n   - Improved ability to diagnose and resolve issues quickly\n   - Enhanced security by providing more context around sensitive operations\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for existing log statements that provide minimal information\n   - Identify error-prone or security-sensitive areas of the code\n   - Review exception handling and error reporting mechanisms\n   - Examine areas where system state or configuration details are important\n\n4. General application:\n   - Use descriptive and context-rich log messages\n   - Include relevant variable values and system states in logs\n   - Implement different log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR) appropriately\n   - Add logging for key operations, especially those involving security or external systems\n   - Ensure error messages are clear and actionable\n   - Consider adding stack traces or error codes where appropriate\n   - Use a consistent logging format across the application\n   - Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys)\n\nBy applying this rule, developers can significantly improve the maintainability, \ndebuggability, and overall quality of their code across various projects and \nprogramming languages."
