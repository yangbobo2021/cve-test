    "general_rule": "Rule: Normalize Path Separators for Cross-Platform Compatibility\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Standardizing path separators in file system operations to ensure consistent behavior across different operating systems.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code portability across different platforms (e.g., Windows, Unix-like systems)\n   - Reduces potential bugs related to path handling on different operating systems\n   - Simplifies path manipulation logic by using a single, consistent separator\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for file path handling code, especially in areas dealing with file I/O, resource loading, or configuration\n   - Search for hardcoded path separators (both forward slashes and backslashes)\n   - Identify functions or methods that work with file paths or directory structures\n   - Review code that needs to run on multiple operating systems\n\n4. General implementation:\n   - Replace platform-specific path separators with a standardized separator (usually forward slash '/')\n   - Use built-in functions or libraries for path manipulation when available\n   - Implement a utility function to normalize paths if not provided by the language or framework\n   - Apply the normalization consistently throughout the codebase\n   - Consider normalizing paths at the entry points of the application (e.g., user input, configuration files)\n\nNote: This rule is applicable across various programming languages and projects that deal with file systems and path handling. It's particularly important for cross-platform applications and libraries."
