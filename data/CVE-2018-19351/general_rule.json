    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security with Content Security Policies\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Adding or strengthening Content Security Policies (CSP) for web applications.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by restricting the execution of scripts and other potentially harmful content.\n   - Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other security vulnerabilities.\n   - Provides an additional layer of protection for user data and application integrity.\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for web application handlers or controllers that serve dynamic content.\n   - Check for areas where user-generated content or external resources are rendered.\n   - Review security headers in HTTP responses, especially for pages that may contain scripts or embedded content.\n\n4. General application:\n   - Implement CSP headers in web application responses.\n   - Use the principle of least privilege when defining CSP rules.\n   - Consider adding sandbox directives for content that doesn't need full privileges.\n   - Regularly review and update CSP policies to address new security concerns and application features."
