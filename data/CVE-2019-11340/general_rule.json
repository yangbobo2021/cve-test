    "general_rule": "Rule: Consistent and Explicit Encoding Handling\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Ensure consistent and explicit handling of text encodings throughout the codebase.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents potential encoding-related errors and inconsistencies\n   - Improves code reliability and reduces unexpected behavior\n   - Enhances compatibility with different character sets and locales\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for operations involving string manipulation, especially when dealing with user input or external data sources\n   - Check for implicit encoding/decoding operations or assumptions about default encodings\n   - Review areas where data is transferred between different systems or components\n\n4. General application:\n   - Always specify the encoding when reading from or writing to files\n   - Use explicit encoding/decoding methods when converting between bytes and strings\n   - Maintain consistent encoding throughout data processing pipelines\n   - Be aware of the encoding requirements of external libraries and APIs\n   - Consider using Unicode (e.g., UTF-8) as the default encoding for better internationalization support"
