    "general_rule": "Rule: Replace overly permissive attribute validation with explicit whitelisting\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   This change replaces a permissive attribute validation function with an explicit list of allowed attributes.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved security by limiting the potential attack surface\n   - Better control over allowed HTML attributes\n   - Easier maintenance and auditing of permitted attributes\n   - Potentially improved performance by avoiding function calls for each attribute\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for security-related functions that use broad allow-all policies\n   - Search for validation functions that return True without inspecting inputs\n   - Review HTML sanitization or input validation code\n   - Examine areas of the codebase dealing with user-generated content or external data\n\n4. General application:\n   When dealing with input validation, especially for security-sensitive features like HTML sanitization, prefer explicit whitelisting over permissive policies. Replace broad allow-all functions with specific lists of allowed elements, attributes, or values. This approach enhances security, improves maintainability, and often leads to better performance.\n\n   This principle can be applied to various scenarios beyond HTML validation, such as:\n   - API input validation\n   - File upload type restrictions\n   - Database query parameter sanitization\n   - Configuration option validation\n\n   Always consider the security implications and maintenance aspects when choosing between permissive and restrictive validation approaches."
