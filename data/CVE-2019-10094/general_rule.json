    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Resource Management in Recursive Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Implement a more robust and secure handling mechanism for recursive parsing operations, especially when dealing with embedded resources.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved security by preventing potential vulnerabilities related to nested content processing\n   - Better resource management and control over parsing operations\n   - Enhanced flexibility and maintainability of the codebase\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   Look for areas in your codebase where:\n   - Recursive operations are performed on complex data structures or nested content\n   - Security checks are needed at multiple levels of processing\n   - Resource limits (e.g., processing time, memory usage) need to be enforced across nested operations\n   - State management becomes complex due to recursive calls\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement wrapper classes or decorators that can manage state and security across recursive operations\n   - Use context objects to pass and update state information throughout the recursive process\n   - Implement resource tracking mechanisms that work across multiple levels of recursion\n   - Design flexible handler interfaces that can be easily swapped or updated at different stages of processing\n   - Consider using factory methods or dependency injection to create and manage handlers for different processing stages"
