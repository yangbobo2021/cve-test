    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Proper Data Escaping\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Enhance security by escaping user-supplied or dynamic data before rendering it in the output.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n   - Improves overall application security\n   - Ensures proper rendering of special characters in the output\n   - Reduces the risk of unintended HTML injection\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for areas where dynamic data is directly output to the user interface\n   - Review template files and any code that generates HTML or user-facing content\n   - Pay special attention to variables used in translation functions or localization mechanisms\n   - Examine places where user input or database-retrieved data is displayed\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use appropriate escaping functions provided by your framework or templating engine\n   - Apply escaping consistently across all user-facing output\n   - Consider implementing a policy or automated checks to ensure all dynamic data is properly escaped\n   - Educate development team members about the importance of data escaping and how to implement it correctly"
