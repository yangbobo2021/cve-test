    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Flexibility in User Input Handling\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   The change involves adding input sanitization and formatting to user-provided content before displaying or processing it.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by preventing potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks\n   - Enhances flexibility by allowing safe use of formatted text in user inputs\n   - Maintains consistency in how user-provided content is displayed throughout the application\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for areas where user-provided input is directly displayed or used in the application\n   - Check for string concatenation or direct insertion of user input into HTML or other output\n   - Review error handling and logging mechanisms that might display user input\n   - Examine configuration options or settings that accept free-form text input\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement a centralized input sanitization and formatting mechanism\n   - Apply this mechanism consistently wherever user input is used\n   - Use appropriate escaping or encoding based on the context where the input is used (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, SQL)\n   - Consider using existing libraries or frameworks that provide secure input handling\n   - Regularly review and update the sanitization process to address new security threats"
