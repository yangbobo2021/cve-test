    "general_rule": "Rule: Validate and Handle Decryption Results Safely\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   This optimization focuses on improving the handling of decryption results in cryptographic operations.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by preventing potential vulnerabilities caused by invalid decryption results\n   - Improves robustness of the code by explicitly checking for expected output\n   - Maintains consistent behavior even when decryption fails or produces unexpected results\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   Look for cryptographic operations, especially those involving decryption or data transformation, where the result is directly used without validation. Key areas to examine include:\n   - Decryption functions\n   - Data parsing operations\n   - Any operation where the output is expected to have a specific format or length\n\n4. General Application:\n   When performing cryptographic operations or data transformations:\n   a. Always check the output for null values\n   b. Verify that the output meets expected criteria (e.g., length, format)\n   c. Have a fallback mechanism or default value in case of failure\n   d. Avoid exposing sensitive information or throwing exceptions that could reveal internal workings\n   e. Maintain a consistent interface even when internal operations fail\n\nThis rule can be applied across various programming languages and projects dealing with cryptography, data processing, or any scenario where the integrity and format of output data are critical."
