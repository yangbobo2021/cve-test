    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security with Built-in Protection Mechanisms\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add built-in security features provided by the framework or language.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by protecting against common vulnerabilities\n   - Reduces the need for custom security implementations\n   - Leverages well-tested and maintained security features\n   - Demonstrates adherence to security best practices\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Review framework documentation for built-in security features\n   - Analyze the application's entry points and data handling\n   - Check for missing standard security measures in base classes or modules\n   - Look for areas where custom security logic might be replaced with framework-provided solutions\n\n4. General Applicability:\n   This rule can be applied to various projects and programming languages by:\n   - Familiarizing yourself with security features offered by the framework or language\n   - Identifying core components that handle user input or sensitive operations\n   - Assessing the current security measures in place\n   - Implementing appropriate built-in protections where they are missing\n   - Replacing custom security implementations with standard, well-maintained alternatives when possible\n\nRemember to always stay updated with the latest security recommendations for your chosen framework or language, and regularly review and update security measures."
