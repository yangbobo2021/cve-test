    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security in Cryptographic Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Strengthening cryptographic functions by using more secure methods and \n   improving randomness in key generation.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases overall security of the application\n   - Reduces vulnerability to potential attacks\n   - Ensures compliance with up-to-date security standards\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review all cryptographic operations in the codebase\n   - Look for outdated or less secure methods of generating random values\n   - Check for hardcoded values or predictable patterns in security-critical areas\n   - Examine key generation and management processes\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use cryptographically secure random number generators\n   - Implement constant-time comparison for sensitive data\n   - Regularly update and use the latest secure hashing algorithms\n   - Avoid using deprecated or weak cryptographic functions\n   - Ensure proper key management and storage\n   - Follow best practices and guidelines for cryptographic implementations"
