    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Input Sanitization and Type Safety\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   - Implement proper input sanitization for external data sources\n   - Ensure type safety for method parameters\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by preventing potential command injection vulnerabilities\n   - Reduces the risk of runtime errors caused by unexpected input types\n   - Enhances code reliability and robustness\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for areas where external input is directly used in system commands or shell operations\n   - Examine method parameters, especially those used in critical operations or calculations\n   - Review code that interacts with external systems or processes user input\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use appropriate sanitization methods for command-line arguments and file paths\n   - Convert input parameters to their expected types before use\n   - Implement input validation and sanitization as close to the input source as possible\n   - Consider using type annotations or type checking mechanisms when available in the language\n   - Regularly audit code for potential security vulnerabilities related to input handling"
