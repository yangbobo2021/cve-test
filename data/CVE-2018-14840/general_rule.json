    "general_rule": "Rule: Comprehensive File Extension Coverage for Security Measures\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Expanding the list of file extensions in security-related configurations to cover a wider range of potentially executable files.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by preventing the execution of a broader set of potentially malicious files\n   - Reduces the risk of overlooking less common but still dangerous file types\n   - Provides a more robust defense against various attack vectors\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review security configurations, especially those related to file handling and execution\n   - Look for lists of file extensions or file types in security settings\n   - Check for any missing or commonly used file extensions that could pose security risks\n   - Consider the specific technologies and file types relevant to your project or environment\n\n4. General Application:\n   When implementing security measures that involve file type restrictions or handling:\n   - Research and include all relevant file extensions for your technology stack\n   - Regularly update the list to account for new or emerging file types\n   - Consider both common and less frequent file extensions that could be exploited\n   - Implement a process for periodically reviewing and updating these configurations\n   - Balance security needs with legitimate use cases in your specific context"
