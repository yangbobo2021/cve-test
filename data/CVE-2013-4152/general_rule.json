    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Performance by Configuring External Libraries\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   This change involves configuring an external library or component with specific settings to improve security and potentially performance.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases the security of the application by disabling potentially dangerous features.\n   - Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities related to external entity processing.\n   - May improve performance by limiting unnecessary processing.\n   - Ensures consistent behavior across different environments.\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for instances where external libraries or components are initialized without custom configuration.\n   - Review documentation of libraries for security-related settings or performance optimizations.\n   - Pay special attention to XML, JSON, or other data parsing libraries.\n   - Consider areas of the code that deal with user input or external data sources.\n\n4. General Application:\n   When using external libraries or components, especially those dealing with data parsing or processing:\n   a. Research the available configuration options.\n   b. Identify settings that can enhance security or performance.\n   c. Apply appropriate configurations during the initialization of these components.\n   d. Document the reasons for chosen configurations to maintain consistency in the future.\n   e. Regularly review and update these configurations as new versions of the libraries are released.\n\nThis rule can be applied across various projects and programming languages, as it focuses on the general principle of properly configuring and securing external dependencies."
