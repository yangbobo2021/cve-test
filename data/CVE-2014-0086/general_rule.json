    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Resource Allocation and Initialization\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Delay the creation and initialization of resource-intensive objects until they are actually needed.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces unnecessary resource consumption\n   - Improves performance by avoiding premature object creation\n   - Enhances code efficiency and responsiveness\n   - Potentially reduces memory usage\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for object instantiations that occur early in a method or function\n   - Identify objects that are created but not always used\n   - Search for resource-intensive operations that may not be necessary in all execution paths\n   - Review code paths where certain objects are only needed under specific conditions\n\n4. General application:\n   - Analyze the lifecycle of objects and their usage patterns\n   - Move object creation and initialization closer to where they are first used\n   - Use lazy initialization techniques when appropriate\n   - Consider using factory methods or dependency injection to manage object creation\n   - Implement conditional logic to create objects only when required\n   - Refactor code to separate concerns and improve modularity, making it easier to optimize resource allocation"
