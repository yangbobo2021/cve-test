   Quoting is applied to :class:`.Function` names, those which are usually but
   not necessarily generated from the :attr:`.sql.func` construct,  at compile
   time if they contain illegal characters, such as spaces or punctuation. The
   names are as before treated as case insensitive however, meaning if the
   names contain uppercase or mixed case characters, that alone does not
   trigger quoting. The case insensitivity is currently maintained for
   backwards compatibility.
