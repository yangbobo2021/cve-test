    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security by Disabling Potentially Vulnerable Features\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Disabling or restricting potentially vulnerable features or configurations in external libraries or dependencies.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces attack surface and potential security vulnerabilities\n   - Improves overall system security\n   - Prevents exploitation of known weaknesses in external components\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Review security best practices for libraries and frameworks used in the project\n   - Check for configuration options related to external resource loading, parsing, or processing\n   - Look for features that allow loading of external entities or resources\n   - Investigate options to disable or restrict potentially dangerous functionalities\n\n4. General application:\n   - Identify security-critical components in the system\n   - Research known vulnerabilities and best practices for those components\n   - Look for configuration options or API calls that can enhance security\n   - Implement restrictive settings by default\n   - Document any security-enhancing changes for future reference and maintenance"
