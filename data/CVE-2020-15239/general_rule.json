    "general_rule": "Rule: Simplify and Consolidate Path Handling\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Consolidate and simplify path handling operations into a single, reusable function.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability\n   - Reduces duplication of path-related logic\n   - Centralizes security checks for path operations\n   - Makes it easier to modify or update path handling behavior across the entire codebase\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for repeated patterns of path manipulation or validation\n   - Identify multiple functions that perform similar operations on file paths\n   - Search for security-sensitive operations related to file paths\n   - Check for inconsistent path handling across different parts of the codebase\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Create a utility function that handles all path-related operations\n   - Ensure the utility function includes necessary security checks\n   - Replace individual path handling operations throughout the codebase with calls to the utility function\n   - Consider using built-in libraries or framework functions for path handling when available\n   - Standardize error handling for path-related operations\n\nThis rule can be applied to various projects and programming languages where file path handling is a common operation, especially in web applications, file management systems, or any software that deals with file I/O operations."
