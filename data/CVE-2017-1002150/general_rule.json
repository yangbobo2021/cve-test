    "general_rule": "Rule: Strengthen Input Validation and Security Checks\n\n1. Type of improvement: \n   Adding stricter validation and security checks on user-provided inputs and URLs.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents potential security vulnerabilities like open redirects\n   - Reduces attack surface by limiting unintended functionality\n   - Improves overall robustness and reliability of the application\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Review functions that handle user inputs, especially those used in URL generation or redirection\n   - Look for places where external data is used to construct URLs or file paths\n   - Examine areas where user-provided data influences application behavior\n\n4. General application:\n   - Add checks to ensure inputs match expected formats and ranges\n   - Validate and sanitize all user-provided data before use\n   - Implement whitelisting for allowed values where possible\n   - Use built-in language/framework functions for input handling when available\n   - Add explicit checks for potentially dangerous operations\n   - Consider the security implications of each input and how it's used"
