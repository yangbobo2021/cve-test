    "general_rule": "Rule: Minimize Object Creation for Performance-Critical Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Reduce unnecessary object creation, especially in frequently executed code paths.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Decreases memory allocation and garbage collection overhead\n   - Improves performance by reducing CPU and memory usage\n   - Enhances overall system efficiency, particularly in high-throughput scenarios\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for object instantiation within loops or frequently called methods\n   - Analyze performance-critical sections of code for object creation\n   - Review code for repeated creation of similar objects that could be reused\n   - Examine constructors or factory methods for opportunities to return existing instances\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Consider using object pools for frequently created and discarded objects\n   - Implement lazy initialization for objects that may not always be needed\n   - Use static factory methods that can cache and return existing instances\n   - Employ the Flyweight pattern for sharing common object state\n   - Utilize immutable objects where possible to safely reuse instances\n   - Profile your application to identify hotspots of object creation\n\nNote: Always balance the trade-off between reduced object creation and code readability. Optimize only when there's a measurable performance benefit, and document the reasons for optimization to maintain code clarity."
