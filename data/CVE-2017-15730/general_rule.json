    "general_rule": "Rule: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Adding CSRF protection to form submissions and sensitive actions.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by preventing unauthorized actions triggered by malicious websites.\n   - Protects users from inadvertently performing unintended actions.\n   - Reduces the risk of session hijacking and related vulnerabilities.\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for forms or links that trigger state-changing actions (e.g., deletions, updates).\n   - Identify GET requests that modify server-side data or perform sensitive operations.\n   - Review areas of the application where authentication is required but CSRF protection is missing.\n\n4. General application:\n   - Generate and store a unique token for each user session.\n   - Include the token in forms as a hidden field or in the URL for GET requests.\n   - Validate the token on the server-side before processing the request.\n   - Implement token regeneration after successful form submissions.\n   - Apply CSRF protection consistently across all sensitive actions in the application.\n\nThis rule can be applied to various web applications, regardless of the specific programming language or framework used. It's a crucial security measure that should be implemented as a best practice in web development."
