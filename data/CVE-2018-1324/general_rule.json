    "general_rule": "Rule: Use appropriate data types for loop counters\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Changing the data type of loop counters to match the expected range of values.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code correctness by ensuring the loop counter can represent all possible values\n   - Prevents potential overflow issues\n   - Enhances code readability and maintainability\n   - May slightly improve performance in some cases\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Review loops that iterate over collections or arrays\n   - Check if the loop counter's data type matches the size or length of the iterated object\n   - Look for loops with large iteration counts or those processing data structures that may contain a large number of elements\n   - Pay attention to loops using integer types for counters when dealing with potentially large datasets\n\n4. General applicability:\n   This rule can be applied to any programming language that uses loops and has different integer data types. It's particularly important in languages with fixed-size integer types and when dealing with large datasets or long-running processes.\n\nAlways choose the most appropriate data type for loop counters based on the expected range of values and the size of the data being processed. This practice contributes to more robust and maintainable code across various projects and languages."
