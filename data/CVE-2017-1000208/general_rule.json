    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security in Data Deserialization\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Use secure deserialization methods or constructors when parsing untrusted data, especially for formats like YAML that can potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by preventing potential code execution vulnerabilities\n   - Reduces the risk of deserialization attacks\n   - Enhances overall robustness of the application when handling external data\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for data parsing or deserialization operations, especially those involving external or user-supplied input\n   - Pay special attention to flexible data formats like YAML, XML, or JSON that might allow for code execution\n   - Review usage of third-party libraries for data parsing and ensure they're used with secure configurations\n   - Conduct a security audit of data input and deserialization processes throughout the codebase\n\n4. General Applicability:\n   This principle applies to any application that deserializes data, regardless of the programming language or specific libraries used. Always prefer secure parsing methods that restrict code execution capabilities when working with untrusted data sources."
