    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Data Structure Initialization\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Initializing data structures with known or estimated capacity upfront.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces memory reallocation and copying operations\n   - Improves performance, especially for frequently accessed or modified structures\n   - Decreases memory fragmentation\n\n3. Identifying opportunities:\n   - Look for data structures (e.g., lists, maps, sets) initialized without capacity\n   - Focus on structures that are likely to grow or are used in performance-critical sections\n   - Pay attention to loops or methods that repeatedly add items to collections\n\n4. General application:\n   - When creating a collection, consider if the size is known or can be estimated\n   - For dynamic structures, use a reasonable initial capacity based on expected usage\n   - Be cautious not to overallocate memory for rarely filled structures\n   - Consider using specialized data structures optimized for specific use cases\n   - Profile your application to identify hotspots where this optimization would be most beneficial\n\nNote: The specific syntax for initializing data structures with capacity varies by programming language and collection type. Always refer to the language's best practices and documentation when implementing this optimization."
