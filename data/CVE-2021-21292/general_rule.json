    "general_rule": "Rule: Proper String Escaping and Concatenation\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Ensure proper escaping of file paths and command-line arguments, especially when dealing with spaces or special characters.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves reliability of system commands and file operations\n   - Reduces potential errors caused by improperly formatted strings\n   - Enhances security by preventing command injection vulnerabilities\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for string concatenation involving file paths or system commands\n   - Check for hardcoded file paths or command-line arguments\n   - Review code that interacts with the operating system or external processes\n   - Examine areas where user input is used to construct file paths or commands\n\n4. General application:\n   - Use appropriate string escaping mechanisms for the target environment\n   - Leverage built-in methods or libraries for path manipulation when available\n   - Consider using string formatting or interpolation instead of direct concatenation\n   - Implement input validation and sanitization for user-provided data\n   - Use platform-independent path separators when possible\n   - Test the code with various input scenarios, including paths with spaces and special characters"
