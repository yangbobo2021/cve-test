    "general_rule": "Rule: Add Security Checks to Public API Methods\n\n1. Type of improvement: \n   Adding permission checks to public methods that perform sensitive operations\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents unauthorized access to critical functionality\n   - Improves overall security of the application\n   - Enforces proper access control at the API level\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for public methods that:\n     a) Modify system configuration\n     b) Send emails or notifications\n     c) Access or modify sensitive data\n     d) Perform administrative actions\n   - Check if these methods have any permission or authorization checks\n   - Review API endpoints for security vulnerabilities\n\n4. General application:\n   - Applicable to any application with user roles and permissions\n   - Can be implemented in various programming languages and frameworks\n   - Especially important for web applications and APIs\n   - Should be considered for both new and existing code\n\nImplementation tips:\n- Use a centralized permission checking mechanism\n- Log unauthorized access attempts\n- Provide clear error messages for permission denied scenarios\n- Regularly audit and review permission checks\n- Consider using aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting security concerns"
