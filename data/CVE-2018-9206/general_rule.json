    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Validation in File Upload Handlers\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add configuration options to restrict file types and implement security measures for file uploads.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves application security by preventing potentially malicious file uploads\n   - Reduces the risk of server-side and client-side code execution vulnerabilities\n   - Provides better control over the types of files that can be uploaded\n   - Encourages developers to consider security implications of file uploads\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review file upload functionality in the codebase\n   - Look for areas where user input is accepted without proper validation\n   - Identify configuration options that could be added to enhance security\n   - Check for missing or incomplete file type restrictions\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement strict file type validation for all file upload features\n   - Use configuration options to make security settings easily adjustable\n   - Add clear comments explaining security implications and best practices\n   - Ensure server-side validation is in place, regardless of client-side checks\n   - Consider implementing additional security measures like file content analysis\n   - Regularly review and update allowed file types based on application requirements"
