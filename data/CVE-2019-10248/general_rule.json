How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Search for HTTP URLs in configuration files, build scripts, and source code\n   - Look for references to external resources, repositories, or dependencies\n   - Pay special attention to URLs in XML, JSON, or YAML configuration files\n   - Check for URLs in dependency management systems (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm)\n\n4. General application:\n   This rule can be applied to any project that references external resources,\n   regardless of the programming language or framework used. It is particularly\n   relevant for build configuration files, dependency declarations, and any\n   code that makes network requests to external services."
