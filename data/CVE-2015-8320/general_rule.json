    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security Logging for Sensitive Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add detailed error logging for security-related operations, especially those involving access control or authentication.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves system security by providing more information about potential security breaches\n   - Aids in debugging and troubleshooting security issues\n   - Enhances audit trails for security-related events\n   - Helps in early detection of malicious activities or attempts\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for methods that verify user permissions, tokens, or secrets\n   - Examine code that handles authentication or authorization\n   - Review areas where the system interacts with external inputs or requests\n   - Identify critical operations that could be exploited if accessed improperly\n\n4. General Application:\n   When implementing security checks or access controls, include comprehensive logging that captures:\n   - The nature of the security event (e.g., failed authentication, unauthorized access attempt)\n   - Relevant context (e.g., user ID, IP address, affected resource)\n   - Potential impact or risk level\n   - Timestamp of the event\n\n   Ensure that logs are written to a secure location and follow proper log management practices to prevent log tampering or unauthorized access to sensitive information in the logs."
