    "general_rule": "Rule: Strengthen Cryptographic Implementations\n\n1. Type of improvement: \n   Enhancing the security and robustness of cryptographic algorithms by addressing known vulnerabilities and following best practices.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves overall security of the cryptographic implementation\n   - Reduces potential attack vectors\n   - Aligns the code with current cryptographic standards and recommendations\n   - Increases resilience against both known and potential future exploits\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Review cryptographic implementations against the latest security research and standards\n   - Look for areas where random number generation or prime number selection is used\n   - Examine key generation processes for potential weaknesses\n   - Check for proper parameter validation and error handling in cryptographic functions\n   - Consider edge cases that could lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., special prime numbers, boundary conditions)\n\n4. General applicability:\n   This rule can be applied to any project involving cryptographic implementations, regardless of the specific programming language or framework used. It emphasizes the importance of staying updated with the latest cryptographic research and continuously improving security measures in code that deals with encryption, decryption, signing, or verification processes."
