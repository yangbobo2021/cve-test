    "general_rule": "Rule: Consolidate Similar Conditions for Improved Readability and Maintainability\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Combining similar conditional statements or logic branches that perform the same or very similar operations.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability by reducing repetition and complexity\n   - Enhances maintainability by centralizing related logic\n   - Reduces the likelihood of inconsistencies when updating code\n   - May slightly improve performance by reducing redundant checks\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for multiple conditional statements (if/else if/switch) that have overlapping conditions or outcomes\n   - Search for repeated code blocks with minor variations\n   - Analyze switch statements or long chains of if/else if statements for potential consolidation\n   - Review error handling or data validation routines for similar patterns across different data types or inputs\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Identify the common elements or patterns in the similar conditions\n   - Create a more generalized condition that encompasses all relevant cases\n   - Refactor the code to use the consolidated condition, ensuring that all edge cases are still handled correctly\n   - Add comments or documentation to explain the consolidated logic if it becomes more complex\n   - Test thoroughly to ensure that the refactored code maintains the original functionality\n\nNote: While consolidating conditions can improve code quality, be cautious not to over-generalize or create overly complex conditions that may reduce readability or introduce subtle bugs. Always prioritize clarity and correctness over conciseness."
