    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Resource Management in Recursive Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Implement a more robust and secure handling mechanism for recursive parsing operations, especially when dealing with embedded resources.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved security by preventing potential vulnerabilities related to nested content processing\n   - Better resource management and control over parsing operations\n   - Enhanced flexibility and maintainability of the code\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   Look for recursive operations in your codebase, particularly those involving:\n   - Parsing of complex data structures or file formats\n   - Processing of nested or embedded content\n   - Operations that may be vulnerable to malicious input or resource exhaustion attacks\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement a dedicated handler for managing recursive operations\n   - Use context objects to pass state and configuration through recursive calls\n   - Implement security checks at each level of recursion\n   - Manage resources carefully, releasing them as soon as they're no longer needed\n   - Consider using decorators or wrappers to add functionality without modifying core parsing logic\n   - Implement limits on recursion depth or resource usage to prevent potential attacks or excessive resource consumption"
