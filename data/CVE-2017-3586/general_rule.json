    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security and Flexibility in SSL/TLS Implementation\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   The changes focus on improving the SSL/TLS implementation by adding more robust certificate validation, supporting system-wide SSL settings, and providing better error handling and logging.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increased security through more thorough certificate validation\n   - Better compatibility with different SSL/TLS configurations\n   - Improved error handling and diagnostics\n   - More flexible and configurable SSL/TLS setup\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for SSL/TLS implementations in network communication code\n   - Check for hardcoded SSL/TLS configurations that could be made more flexible\n   - Examine error handling in security-related code\n   - Review certificate validation processes for potential improvements\n\n4. General Applicability:\n   This optimization can be applied to any project that uses SSL/TLS for secure communication, regardless of the programming language. The principles of improving certificate validation, supporting system-wide settings, and enhancing error handling are universal in secure network programming."
