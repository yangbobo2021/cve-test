    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security by Tightening Permission Checks\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Replacing overly permissive permission checks with more specific, granular permissions.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves overall system security by adhering to the principle of least privilege\n   - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive operations\n   - Provides better auditability and control over user actions\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review security-sensitive operations, especially those involving system administration or data access\n   - Look for permission checks that use broad, high-level permissions\n   - Examine areas of the code that handle user requests for privileged actions\n   - Pay attention to API endpoints, command execution functions, and configuration changes\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Replace generic admin-level permissions with more specific, action-based permissions\n   - Create new, fine-grained permission types if necessary\n   - Update documentation and user guides to reflect the new permission requirements\n   - Consider implementing a permission hierarchy to simplify management\n   - Regularly audit and review permission usage across the application"
