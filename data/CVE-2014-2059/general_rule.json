    "general_rule": "Rule: Validate Input Early\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Add input validation checks as early as possible in the execution flow.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents invalid data from propagating through the system\n   - Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior or errors later in the process\n   - Improves code robustness and reliability\n   - Provides clearer and more immediate feedback to users or calling functions\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for functions or methods that accept user input or external data\n   - Examine code paths where assumptions are made about data validity\n   - Review error-prone areas of the codebase or those with a history of bugs\n   - Consider critical operations where data integrity is crucial\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Implement validation checks at the entry points of functions or methods\n   - Use built-in language features or libraries for common validations\n   - Create custom validation functions for domain-specific rules\n   - Ensure validation errors are handled gracefully and provide meaningful feedback\n   - Consider adding assertions for internal consistency checks in addition to user input validation\n\nThis rule can be applied across various programming languages and project types to improve code quality, reduce errors, and enhance overall system reliability."
