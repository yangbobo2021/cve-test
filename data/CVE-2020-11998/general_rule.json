    "general_rule": "Rule: Minimize Object Creation and Reuse Existing Resources\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Reduce unnecessary object creation and initialization, especially for \n   frequently used or resource-intensive objects.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improved performance by reducing memory allocation and garbage collection\n   - Lower CPU usage due to fewer object initializations\n   - Better resource utilization and potentially reduced memory footprint\n\n3. How to identify similar opportunities:\n   - Look for objects created inside loops or frequently called methods\n   - Identify static or constant objects that could be shared\n   - Search for redundant object creations that could be replaced with reuse\n   - Analyze object lifecycles to determine if they can be extended or shared\n\n4. General application:\n   - Use object pools for frequently created and destroyed objects\n   - Implement lazy initialization for objects that may not always be needed\n   - Convert mutable objects to immutable when possible to allow safe sharing\n   - Use static factory methods to control object creation and reuse\n   - Employ caching mechanisms for expensive-to-create objects\n   - Consider using flyweight pattern for objects with shared state\n   - Utilize dependency injection to manage object lifecycles and sharing\n\nRemember to balance object reuse with code readability and maintainability. \nExcessive optimization can lead to more complex code, so always measure the \nimpact of changes and ensure they provide meaningful improvements."
