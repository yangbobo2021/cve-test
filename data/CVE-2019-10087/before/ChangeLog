       * new `o.a.w.pages` package, with `PageSorter` becoming a `Comparator< String >` and no longer accesible from WikiContext

         * to compare WikiPages use `wikiPage.compareTo( anotherWikiPage );`
         * `sortPages` methods are also gone, as an alternative you can use something along these lines (see
           `AttachmentManager#listAttachments` for another example):
           `Collections.< WikiPage >sort( pages, Comparator.comparing( WikiPage::getName, m_engine.getPageManager().getPageSorter() ) );`
         * as a side effect of this change, `AbstractReferalPlugin#filter[AndSort]Collection` methods operate with
           `Collection< String >` instead of with plain `Collection` (except for `RecentChangesPlugin`, plugins
           inheriting this method were already doing it), custom plugins inheriting this method will have to use
           new `filterWikiPageCollection` method instead

       * Several small style improvements on the navigation bar for mobile devices
         (hiding CARET to indicate hover-menu's, ...)

       * Another fix on JSPWIKI-1064 - Link to non-existing page doesn't change if
         linked page is created, as the page render cache must also take into account
         if the plugins should be rendered or not.

       * JSPWiki portable: Update bundled Apache Tomcat to latest version on 7.x branch
         and launch4j to 3.11.

         fork at https://github.com/teras/appbundler instead.

2018-01-21  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * JSPWIKI-802 - Markdown support
         * urls are not set on attribute provider derived classes, as this has some
           unwanted side effects. Introduced JSPWikiLink, a wrapper around Flexmark's
           links which retain the original wiki link.
         * updated Flexmark to 0.28.24.

2017-11-16  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.3-git-42

       * small refactor to move some private constants to public at MarkupParser and
         WikiRenderer, so they can be reused throughout the code and custom extensions.

2017-08-22  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.3-git-41

       * WysiwygEditingRenderer isn't hardcoded in JSPs anymore, and can be substituted
         through jspwiki.renderingManager.renderer.wysiwyg property on jspwiki.properties.
         This allows to develop custom renderers which do not expect the same information
         as the existing ones.

       * Fixed DefaultFilterManager#modules not returning Collection< WikiModuleInfo >,
         as it was supposed to. This method wasn't used anywhere, until now, where it
         is used through FilterBean, a new JSPWiki AdminBean exposing existing filters
         information.

       * FilterBean runs parallel to PluginBean, which allowed some more minor internal
         refactorings and code polishing.

       * Moved some constants from JSPWikiMarkupParser to MarkupParser.

2017-07-16  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

         custom markup parsers, which do not rely on the former class or
         WikiDocument.

       * Fixing some minor issues with the Image plugin ALIGN parameter

       * %%magnify: add a magnifying glass to to reveal details of a cropped images.
         Hover the mouse above the image to see the effect.

       * Redesigned Header
         The header (including the menu bar) now shifts up when you scroll down,
         and reappears when scrolling back-up.  So you can quickly have access
         to all the menu's and the quick search function.  Clicking the pagename
         in the header get's you immediately back to the top of the page.
         The menu bar has now become part of the (coloured) header section.

       * Editor:
         Improved the speed of the editor quick preview when editing large pages.
         Updates to various editor auto-suggest dialogs.

         escape HTML entities in captions.

       * several CSS stylesheet additions
         - image styles : effects, captions, frames, animation
         - background styles : color, background images

       * JSPWIKI-1050 The find and replace do not seem to work  (Haddock editor)

         Pressing Ctrl-F has been removed as short-cut key for the wiki editor.
         Ctrl-F brings you always to the standard browser dialog. (as expected)
         To open JSPWiki's Find&Replace dialog, click the toolbar button.

         The Find&Replace dialog now also indicates if text was selected before.
         If that case, the Find&Replace will run only on the selected text.

       * Improved the stability of the  WysiwygEditingRenderer



2015-08-22  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-33  Fixed JSPWIKI-910 support configuring jspwiki with envvars
                        having dots replaced with underscores in the varnames

2015-08-16  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-32  Haddock Template updates & WYSIWYG editing

       Haddock Template:

       * [JSPWIKI-902] Printing improvements for the HADDOCK template,
         hiding sidebar, userbox, wrapping long page-names, and a few other tweaks.

       * The Page Footer now sticks to the bottom of the screen, even for short pages

       * Fixed an issue with the persistence of the status of collapsible lists

       * Added fixes for IE compatibility for the bootstrap css framework.

       * [JSPWIKI-892] Haddock editor should put the cursor at the top of the textarea,
         also when opening the editor with a certain section

       * Improved the header layout (suggestion of Harry) moving the quick search field
         into the searchbox dropdown.

       * [JSPWIKI-908] The basic editor toolbar icons (bold, italic, link, etc..)
         are back in the plain editor of HADDOCK.


       WYSIWYG further enhancements

       * (experimental) Included a plain vanilla wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki.
         This editor is based on mooEditable, MIT licensed.
         This editor is unfortunately not compatible with the default template.

         You can still add your own wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki -- hooks are provided
         for TinyMCE and CKeditor.

       * Added ajax-based live-preview for wysiwyg editors to the Haddock Template.
         When editing in wysiwyg mode, you now get immediately a preview of the wiki markup.
         (similar to the live-preview mode of the plain editor)

       * The wysiwyg editors are now resizable, just like the plain editor..


2015-08-04  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-31  Haddock Template small fixes

       * Loading error on hadock.js and haddock-edit.js fixed. (async attribute)
         Was breaking all editing js functions !

       * IEx tweaks
         - remove unnecessary scrollbars
         - attempt to resolve the broken icon-fonts on IE11

       * %%add-css style fix to handle special html entities


2015-08-04  David Vittor (dvittor@apache.org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-30

       * [JSPWIKI-900]: Fixed Problem with the WikiFormsPlugin Text Area

2015-08-02  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-29

       Some more Haddock template "tweaks":

       * Hide the attach & info navigation menu's for non-existing page

       * Improved the Info dropdown when no Author page exists.

       * Section titles remain visible, even with a sticky navigation menu.
         Eg. when clicking a table of contents entry, you should end up
         with a visible section header just below the sticky menu line.

       * Fixed: the top border of a TABLE was gone.

       * Added a version check on the user-preference cookie to be more robust ico changes.
         (hopefully no more cookie clean-up is needed when upgrading JSPWiki)

       * Sidebar:
         - The sidebar height now extends till the bottom of the page
         - 3 Sidebar modes are now working: left(default), right and hidden

       * Fixed the <wiki:Link> tag to support "cssClass" as attribute.

       * [JSPWIKI-430] All confirmation dialogs are now build with regular DOM elements.
         (check out the Log-out or Delete confirmation dialogs to see the improvement)


       WYSIWYG editors:

       * Added support for the WYSIWYG editor TinyMCE.jsp

       * Improved server side handling of HtmlStringToWiki translation

       * [JSPWIKI-622] Added an editor selection switch to the editor toolbar.
         It is now possible to switch between editors (plain, or other installed
         wysiwyg editors) while in Edit. (no need to go first via the Preferences screen)



2015-07-26  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-28

       Haddock Template commit of the remaining JSP's: UI for handling groups,
       workflow UI, and refactored JSP's for Login/Lostpw/Register.
       This concludes the re-design of all the haddock template JSP's.

       Other changes:

       * Fixed page redirections and improved the back button handling.
         Eg. Attachment DELETE will get you now back to the ATTACH view,
         not the INFO view.  See also [JSPWIKI-867]

       * Tabs & Accordion toggles can now include other markup, rather than only text.

       * Added CSS3-based automatic text hyphenation for browsers who support this.
         (also works with none justified text)

       * Attachment Upload UI improved: attachment types are represented by icons
         from the icon-font.

       * Attachment Info page to access version information on attachments
         should now be more user-friendly, with an extra INFO action button.
         (iso a hidden link via the version number)



2015-07-16  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-27

       More Haddock Template tweaks:

       * Removed annoying scroll-bars from the dropdown menu's which appeared in some browsers

       * Improved rendering of inserted dropdown's like the MoreMenu and HomeMenu,
         to make them better fit with bootstrap dropdown menu's.

       * Few fixes of the layout of the UserPreferences menu, and some refactoring
         of the UserPreferences.jsp and the Login.jsp.

       * Fixed an editor bug causing the Live Preview to slow down after some time.

       WYSIWYG editor in JSPWiki

       * Refreshed the WYSIWIG editor with the latest stable version of the
         CKeditor v4.5.1. (replacement of FCK) Standard version, with BootstrapCK4 skin.
         The update was done for both for the default and the Haddock template.
         FFS: server side translation from wiki-markup to HTML needs more work.
         ( WysiwygEditingRenderer.getString() often crashes )


2015-07-13  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-26

       * [JSPWIKI-896] Haddock template ‚Äì user preferences are not saved.
         haddock-pref.js was not properly included into the build, due to lowercase
         issue in wro-haddock.xml.

       * [JSPWIKI-518] Saving after editing a section will return you to that  section.
         Fixed missing commits on wiki.js. Should work now.

       * Fixed issue with Accesskey

       * [JSPWIKI-433] Allow back button for TAB keys.
         It is now also possible to click a link to a hidden pane of a tabbed section
         (eg from the Table Of Contents) to automatically open that TAB pane.

       * Added a "title" attribute to the pagename in the header.  In case a very long
         pagename is truncated (with ellipsis ...) you can still see the full
         pagename when you hover the mouse over the pagename.

       This is the second major check-in of the HADDOCK template, with
       fixes and improvements mainly related to the plain editor.

       * Livepreview has been fixed, with ajax based on the fly page rendering.

       * 2.10.1-svn-7

       * Various small fixes on the HADDOCK template (jsp/css/js) :

       * Fixing %%category dropdowns which were clipped when inside a %%accordion.
         Replacing js based animation by2.10.1-svn-12 css3 animation to show/hide the popup.

       * Fixing bug when saving the Preferences (detected by Harry)

       * Changed fixed-width layout into fluid layout, occupying all screen real-estate.
         (this could become a user-preference setting in the future)
         Slightly decreasing the size of the sidebar.

       * 2.10.1-svn-6

       * Fixing the JSONRPCMAnager.emitJSONCall(..) so that it now renders
         the correct JSON RPC invocation javascript.

         You can test the RPCSamplePlugin like this:

              [{RPCSamplePlugin

              test
              }]

         We are still getting error-code: 490, "No permission to access this AJAX method!"
         when invoking a plugin generated json-rpc call.

       * 2.10.1-svn-5

         Introducing the HADDOCK template, a new template/ui for Apache JSPWiki.

         This template contains various UI improvements and JSP simplifications,
         a major redesign of the JSPWiki CSS stylesheet based on BOOTSTRAP
         (now modularly build with LESS) and a rework of the javascript routines
         based on mootools v1.4.x. (also the js is now split into modular class files)

         Be aware: this is a first commit -- expect things to be broken.
         More work is needed on the plain editor; the Group UI is to be fixed.
         Validation has been done against Safari, Chrome & FF;  IE testing is left
         to the adventurous user.

         HADDOCK lives peacefully next to the default template. To activate the new
         template, add following line to your jspwiki-custom.properties:

              jspwiki.templateDir = haddock


       * [JSPWIKI-504] New default look for 3.0

       * [JSPWIKI-431] Attachment Upload, support upload of multiple files, drag&drop,
              improved progress bars.
              However the server functionality to upload multiple files is
              currently broken. FFS

       * [JSPWIKI-432] Simplify Tabbed Section Markup
              Still maintaining backwards compatibility with the current %%tabbedSection
              markup.

       * [JSPWIKI-712] Entites in ChangeNote should be decoded with "keep editing"

       * [JSPWIKI-797] Refactoring the JSPWiki javascript routines, upgrade js libs:
               mootools-core-1.4.5
               mootools-more-1.4.0.1
               prettify (dd. 4 mar 2013)

       * [JSPWIKI-798] Refactoring the JSPWiki main CSS stylesheet -
               now based on the BOOTSTRAP CSS Framework

       * [JSPWIKI-430] DOM based popups to replace regular js alert or prompt dialog boxes
               Also the edit/clone UI has been refactored.
               Some delete confirmation dialog boxes are still to be converted.

       * [JSPWIKI-429] Improved SLIMBOX to support Youtube, flash and other formats.
                You can now also 'slimbox' another wiki-page or an external url.
                Based on this media viewer, also a %%carousel style has been added.

       * [JSPWIKI-478] Remember cookies of collapsible for all contexts
                Collapsible lists and boxes have been refactored, and styled with BOOTSTRAP.
                In general, all %%dynamic-styles are re-styled with BOOTSTRAP css components.

       * [JSPWIKI-693] style issues

       * [JSPWIKI-463] display error in default template

       * [JSPWIKI-449] Menuhide functionality is illogical
                The sidebar (aka Favorites) can be shown/hidden via a toggle button.
                By default, the sidebar is hidden in the Edit/Comment view, to give
                maximum square-meters to the edit text-area.

       * [JSPWIKI-512] CSS Error with Firefox 2.0.20

       *  Upgrade wro4j to latest version 1.7.3
