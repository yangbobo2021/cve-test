    "general_rule": "Rule: Immutability and Defensive Copying\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Enhance object immutability and implement defensive copying for collections.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves thread safety\n   - Prevents unintended modifications of object state\n   - Reduces bugs related to shared mutable state\n   - Simplifies reasoning about code behavior\n\n3. Identifying opportunities:\n   - Look for classes with mutable fields, especially collections\n   - Check for public getter methods that return direct references to internal collections\n   - Examine constructors and builder methods that accept collections as parameters\n   - Review methods that modify internal state after object creation\n\n4. Implementation guidelines:\n   - Make fields final where possible\n   - Use unmodifiable wrappers for collections returned by getter methods\n   - Create defensive copies of collections passed to constructors or builders\n   - Consider using builder patterns for complex object creation\n   - Apply immutability to value objects and configuration classes\n   - Use factory methods to control object creation and ensure immutability\n\nNote: While this rule can significantly improve code quality and reduce bugs, \nit may have a small performance cost due to additional object creation. \nConsider the trade-offs in performance-critical sections of your code."
