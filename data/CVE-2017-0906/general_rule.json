    "general_rule": "Consolidate URL Construction\n\n1. Type of improvement: \nCentralizing and standardizing URL construction logic.\n\n2. Benefits:\n- Reduces code duplication\n- Improves consistency in how URLs are built\n- Makes it easier to modify URL structure globally\n- Enhances maintainability and readability\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\nLook for repeated patterns of URL construction throughout the codebase, especially:\n- String concatenation or interpolation to build URLs\n- Multiple places that prepend a base URL\n- Inconsistent handling of query parameters\n- Scattered URL encoding logic\n\n4. General application:\nCreate a centralized URL builder utility or method that handles:\n- Appending paths to a base URL\n- Adding and encoding query parameters  \n- Applying any global URL prefixes or suffixes\n- Proper URL encoding of components\n\nUse this utility consistently throughout the codebase instead of manual URL construction. This centralizes the logic and makes URLs easier to update globally if needed."
