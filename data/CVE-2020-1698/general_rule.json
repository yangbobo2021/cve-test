    "general_rule": "Rule: Improve Error Message Specificity\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Enhance error messages to provide more specific and actionable information.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves debuggability by providing more context about the error\n   - Reduces time spent on troubleshooting issues\n   - Enhances the overall maintainability of the codebase\n\n3. How to Identify Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for generic error messages or exception handling\n   - Examine areas where additional context could be added to error reporting\n   - Review logging statements and error-prone sections of code\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Replace generic error messages with more specific ones\n   - Include relevant variables or method names in error messages\n   - Add context about the operation being performed when an error occurs\n   - Consider including system state information if applicable\n   - Ensure error messages are clear and actionable for both developers and end-users\n\nThis rule can be applied across various projects and programming languages to improve error handling and debugging capabilities."
