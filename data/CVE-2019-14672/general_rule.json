    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance Security by Properly Escaping User-Supplied Data\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   This change focuses on improving security by properly escaping user-supplied data before outputting it in error messages or logs.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Prevents potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n   - Ensures that error messages and logs don't contain malicious code\n   - Improves overall application security\n   - Maintains data integrity in logs and error messages\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for instances where user-supplied data is directly output in error messages, logs, or HTML responses\n   - Review code that handles user input and check if it's properly sanitized before use\n   - Examine areas where dynamic content is generated and displayed to users\n   - Audit logging statements and error handling code for potential security vulnerabilities\n\n4. General application:\n   - Use appropriate escaping functions provided by your framework or language\n   - Implement a consistent approach to data sanitization across the entire codebase\n   - Create helper functions or utilities to centralize and standardize data escaping\n   - Regularly review and update security practices to address new potential vulnerabilities\n   - Educate team members about the importance of proper data escaping and sanitization"
