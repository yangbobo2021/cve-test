# Defines annotations for ingresses which are used for servers exposing. Value depends on the kind of ingress

#
# OpenShift infrastructure ignores this property because it uses Routes instead of ingresses.
#
# Note that for a single-host deployment strategy to work, a controller supporting URL rewriting has to be
# used (so that URLs can point to different servers while the servers don't need to support changing the app root).
# The che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property defines how the path of the ingress should be
# transformed to support the URL rewriting and this property defines the set of annotations on the ingress itself
# that instruct the chosen ingress controller to actually do the URL rewriting, potentially building on the path
# transformation (if required by the chosen ingress controller).
#
# For example for nginx ingress controller 0.22.0 and later the following value is recommended:
# {"ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target": "/$1","ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect": "false",\
#     "ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout": "3600","ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout": "3600"}
# and the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform should be set to "%s(.*)"
#
# For nginx ingress controller older than 0.22.0, the rewrite-target should be set to merely "/" and the path transform
# to "%s" (see the the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property).

# The "%s" represents the base public URL of the server and is guaranteed to end with a forward slash. This property
# must be a valid input to the String.format() method and contain exactly one reference to "%s".
#
# Please see the description of the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.annotations_json property to see how these two
# properties interplay when specifying the ingress annotations and path.

# If not defined, this property defaults to "%s" (without the quotes) which means that the path is not transformed in

# OpenShift infrastructure reuse most of the Kubernetes configuration attributes.

# In that case, new project will be created for each user. OpenShift oauth or service account with
