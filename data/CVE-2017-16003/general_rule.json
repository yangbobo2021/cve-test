    "general_rule": "Rule: Use Secure URLs for External Resources\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Replace non-secure HTTP URLs with secure HTTPS URLs for external resources.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by using encrypted connections\n   - Reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks\n   - Improves overall application security posture\n   - Helps maintain user trust and data integrity\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Scan the codebase for hardcoded URLs\n   - Look for URLs beginning with \"http://\" that should be using HTTPS\n   - Pay special attention to URLs used for downloading resources, API calls, or external services\n   - Review configuration files, environment variables, and constants for insecure URLs\n\n4. General Application:\n   This rule can be applied to any project that references external resources via URLs, regardless of the programming language or framework used. It's particularly important for applications that handle sensitive data or require secure communications.\n\nNote: Always ensure that the HTTPS version of the resource is available and compatible with your application before making the change."
