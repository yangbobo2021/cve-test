    "general_rule": "Rule: Restrict Modification of Security-Critical Options\n\n1. Type of improvement: \n   Preventing unintended modification of security-sensitive configuration options.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Enhances security by protecting critical settings from accidental changes\n   - Reduces potential vulnerabilities from misconfiguration\n   - Enforces proper channels for modifying security options\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for configuration objects or settings that impact security\n   - Check if sensitive options can be modified through generic data copying/merging\n   - Review places where user-provided data is applied to configurations\n\n4. General application:\n   - Identify security-critical configuration options\n   - Add checks or restrictions when copying/merging configuration data  \n   - Use separate, controlled methods to modify security settings\n   - Document which options should not be modifiable through general interfaces\n   - Add validation to ensure critical options are not unexpectedly altered"
