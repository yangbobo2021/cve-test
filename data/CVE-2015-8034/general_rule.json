    "general_rule": "Rule: Minimize File I/O Operations\n\n1. Type of improvement: Reducing the number of file read/write operations.\n\n2. Benefits: \n   - Improves performance by reducing slow disk I/O\n   - Reduces resource usage and contention\n   - Can simplify code by consolidating file operations\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for repeated open/close operations on the same file\n   - Check for multiple read/write calls that could be combined\n   - Review error handling around file operations for consolidation\n   - Examine caching strategies for frequently accessed files\n\n4. General applicability:\n   This principle applies across many types of software projects and languages. File I/O is often a performance bottleneck, so minimizing it can yield significant improvements. The exact implementation will vary based on the specific language and framework, but the core concept of reducing file operations is widely applicable."
