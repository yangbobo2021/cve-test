    "general_rule": "Rule: Sanitize and Escape User Input for System Commands\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Enhancing security and preventing potential command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases the overall security of the application\n   - Prevents malicious users from executing arbitrary commands\n   - Reduces the risk of data breaches and system compromises\n   - Ensures that the application behaves as intended with various types of input\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for areas where user input is directly used in system commands or shell operations\n   - Review functions that interact with the file system, execute external programs, or perform database queries\n   - Examine code that constructs command-line arguments or SQL queries using string concatenation\n   - Pay attention to areas where input is passed to lower-level system functions or APIs\n\n4. General application:\n   - Always treat user input as potentially malicious\n   - Use appropriate escaping or sanitization functions provided by the language or framework\n   - Implement input validation to ensure that only expected data formats are processed\n   - Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements for database operations\n   - Employ the principle of least privilege when executing system commands\n   - Use allowlists instead of blocklists when filtering input\n   - Regularly audit and update input sanitization practices to address new security threats"
