    "general_rule": "Rule: Conditional Feature Activation Based on Environment\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Selectively enabling or disabling features based on the application's running environment.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Reduces unnecessary code execution in production environments\n   - Improves security by limiting access to potentially sensitive operations\n   - Optimizes performance by removing debug-only features from production builds\n   - Allows for easier testing and debugging in development environments\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Look for routes, endpoints, or functions that are primarily used for debugging or development purposes\n   - Identify features that expose internal data or provide direct manipulation of application state\n   - Review code for commented-out sections that are only occasionally needed during development\n   - Examine configuration files for environment-specific settings that could be applied to code execution\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use environment variables or configuration flags to determine the current running environment\n   - Wrap development-only features in conditional statements that check the environment\n   - Consider creating separate modules or plugins for development-only functionality that can be easily excluded from production builds\n   - Implement a robust logging system that can be configured to provide different levels of detail based on the environment\n   - Use build tools or deployment scripts to automatically remove or disable development features in production releases"
