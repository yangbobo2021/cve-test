    [`bug 1855080 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1855080>`_]
    An error in the policy target filtering inadvertently allowed any user to
    list any credential object with the /v3/credentials API when
    ``[oslo_policy]/enforce_scope`` was set to false, which is the default.
    This has been addressed: users with non-admin roles on a project may not
    list other users' credentials. However, users with the admin role on a
    project may still list any users credentials when
    ``[oslo_policy]/enforce_scope`` is false due to `bug 968696
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/968696>`_.
