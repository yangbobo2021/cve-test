    "general_rule": "Rule: Consolidate and Streamline Import Statements\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   Organizing and optimizing import statements at the top of a file.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves code readability and maintainability\n   - Reduces potential namespace conflicts\n   - Can slightly improve performance by reducing import overhead\n   - Makes dependencies clearer and easier to manage\n\n3. How to identify opportunities:\n   - Look for multiple import statements scattered throughout a file\n   - Check for redundant or unused imports\n   - Identify imports that could be combined or use more efficient syntax\n   - Review import statements for deprecated or outdated modules\n\n4. General application:\n   - Group related imports together\n   - Use language-specific features to simplify imports where possible\n   - Place all imports at the top of the file, unless there's a specific reason not to\n   - Remove any unused imports\n   - Consider using relative imports for local modules when appropriate\n   - Use consistent formatting and ordering for import statements\n\nThis rule can be applied across different programming languages and projects to improve code organization and efficiency."
