    "general_rule": "Rule: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for specific endpoints\n\n1. Type of improvement:\n   This change adds CORS support to the application, allowing controlled access to resources from different origins.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves security by explicitly defining which origins can access specific resources\n   - Enables integration with external services or applications\n   - Provides a more flexible architecture for distributed systems\n   - Enhances user experience by allowing safe cross-origin requests\n\n3. Identifying similar opportunities:\n   - Look for web applications or APIs that may need to interact with resources from different domains\n   - Review security configurations to see if CORS is already implemented or if it's needed\n   - Analyze client-side code that makes requests to the server to identify potential cross-origin scenarios\n   - Consider the application's architecture and whether it needs to support multiple front-ends or third-party integrations\n\n4. General application:\n   - Implement CORS configuration at the application or framework level\n   - Define specific endpoints or routes that require CORS support\n   - Configure allowed origins, methods, and headers based on security requirements\n   - Use environment-specific settings to manage CORS configuration across different deployments\n   - Regularly review and update CORS settings to maintain security and functionality"
