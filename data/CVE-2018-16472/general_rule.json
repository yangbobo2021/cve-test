    "general_rule": "Rule: Optimize Object Creation for Performance-Critical Operations\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Replace standard object creation with a more efficient method when\n   initializing frequently accessed data structures.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Improves performance by reducing overhead associated with object creation\n   - Eliminates potential issues with inherited properties from Object.prototype\n   - Can lead to faster property lookups and better memory usage\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Look for objects used as caches or lookup tables\n   - Focus on data structures that are frequently accessed or modified\n   - Pay attention to objects created in performance-critical sections of code\n   - Consider the scale and frequency of object creation and access\n\n4. General Application:\n   When creating objects intended for use as simple key-value stores or caches,\n   consider using more efficient initialization methods provided by your\n   programming language or runtime environment. These methods often create\n   \"bare\" objects without the default object prototype, which can lead to\n   performance improvements in certain scenarios.\n\n   However, always benchmark and profile your specific use case to ensure\n   the optimization provides meaningful benefits, as the impact may vary\n   depending on the programming language, runtime environment, and specific\n   usage patterns in your application."
