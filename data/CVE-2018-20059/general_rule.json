    "general_rule": "Rule: Enhance XML Parsing Security and Performance\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Implement secure XML parsing techniques to prevent XML-based attacks and improve parsing performance.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Mitigates security vulnerabilities such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks\n   - Improves control over XML parsing behavior\n   - Potentially enhances parsing performance for large XML documents\n\n3. Identifying Opportunities:\n   - Look for XML parsing operations, especially in data exchange or configuration loading functions\n   - Review code that uses standard XML parsers without custom security configurations\n   - Examine areas where XML input is accepted from external or untrusted sources\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Use XML parsing libraries or configurations that disable external entity processing by default\n   - Implement strict controls on DTD (Document Type Definition) usage\n   - Configure XML parsers to limit resource usage (e.g., entity expansion limits)\n   - Consider using streaming parsers for large XML documents to improve memory efficiency\n   - Apply these principles to any technology stack or programming language that involves XML processing\n\nNote: Always balance security measures with performance requirements and maintain compatibility with legitimate XML features needed for your specific use case."
