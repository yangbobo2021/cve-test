=== What's New

==== Changes in 1.5 Since 1.4

===== spring-erlang is No Longer Supported

The `spring-erlang` jar is no longer included in the distribution.
Use <<management-template>> instead.

===== CachingConnectionFactory Changes

====== Empty Addresses Property in CachingConnectionFactory

Previously, if the connection factory was configured with a host/port, but an empty String was also supplied for
`addresses`, the host and port were ignored.
Now, an empty `addresses` String is treated the same as a `null`, and the host/port will be used.

====== URI Constructor

The `CachingConnectionFactory` has an additional constructor, with a `URI` parameter, to configure the broker connection.

====== Connection Reset

A new method `resetConnection()` has been added to allow users to reset the connection (or connections).
This might be used, for example, to reconnect to the primary broker after failing over to the secondary broker.
This *will* impact in-process operations.
The existing `destroy()` method does exactly the same, but the new method has a less daunting name.

===== Properties to Control Container Queue Declaration Behavior

When the listener container consumers start, they attempt to passively declare the queues to ensure they are available
on the broker.
Previously, if these declarations failed, for example because the queues didn't exist, or when an HA queue was being
moved, the retry logic was fixed at 3 retry attempts at 5 second intervals.
If the queue(s) still do not exist, the behavior is controlled by the `missingQueuesFatal` property (default true).
Also, for containers configured to listen from multiple queues, if only a subset of queues are available, the consumer
retried the missing queues on a fixed interval of 60 seconds.

These 3 properties (`declarationRetries, failedDeclarationRetryInterval,
				retryDeclarationInterval`) are now configurable.
See <<containerAttributes>> for more information.

===== Class Package Change

The `RabbitGatewaySupport` class has been moved from `o.s.amqp.rabbit.core.support` to `o.s.amqp.rabbit.core`.

===== DefaultMessagePropertiesConverter

The `DefaultMessagePropertiesConverter` can now be configured to
determine the maximum length of a `LongString` that will be converted
to a `String` rather than a `DataInputStream`.
The converter has an alternative constructor that takes the value as a limit.
Previously, this limit was hard-coded at `1024` bytes.
(Also available in _1.4.4_).

===== @RabbitListener Improvements

====== @QueueBinding for @RabbitListener

The `bindings` attribute has been added to the `@RabbitListener` annotation as mutually exclusive with the `queues`
attribute to allow the specification of the `queue`, its `exchange` and `binding` for declaration by a `RabbitAdmin` on
the Broker.

====== SpEL in @SendTo

The default reply address (`@SendTo`) for a `@RabbitListener` can now be a SpEL expression.

====== Multiple Queue Names Via Properties

It is now possible to use a combination of SpEL and property placeholders to specify multiple queues for a listener.

See <<async-annotation-driven>> for more information.

===== Automatic Exchange, Queue, Binding Declaration

It is now possible to declare beans that define a collection of these entities and the `RabbitAdmin` will add the
contents to the list of entities that it will declare when a connection is established.
See <<collection-declaration>> for more information.

===== RabbitTemplate Changes

====== reply-address

The `reply-address` attribute has been added to the `<rabbit-template>` component as an alternative `reply-queue`.
See <<request-reply>> for more information.
(Also available in _1.4.4_ as a setter on the `RabbitTemplate`).

====== Blocking Receive Methods

The `RabbitTemplate` now supports blocking in `receive` and `convertAndReceive` methods.
See <<polling-consumer>> for more information.

====== Mandatory with SendAndReceive Methods

When the `mandatory` flag is set when using `sendAndReceive` and `convertSendAndReceive` methods, the calling thread
will throw an `AmqpMessageReturnedException` if the request message can't be deliverted.
See <<reply-timeout>> for more information.

====== Improper Reply Listener Configuration

The framework will attempt to verify proper configuration of a reply listener container when using a named
reply queue.

See <<reply-listener>> for more information.

===== The RabbitManagementTemplate

The `RabbitManagementTemplate` has been introduced to monitor and configure the RabbitMQ Broker using the REST API
provided by its https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html[Management Plugin].
See <<management-template>> for more information.

===== Listener Container Bean Names (XML)

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `id` attribute on the `<listener-container/>` element has been removed.
Starting with this release, the `id` on the `<listener/>` child element is used alone to name the listener container
bean created for each listener element.

Normal Spring bean name overrides are applied; if a later `<listener/>` is parsed with the same `id` as an existing
bean, the new definition will override the existing one.
Previously, bean names were composed from the ids of the `<listener-container/>` and `<listener/>` elements.

When migrating to this release, if you have `id` s on your `<listener-container/>` elements, remove them and set the
`id` on the child `<listener/>` element instead.
====

However, to support starting/stopping containers as a group, a new `group` attribute has been added.
When this attribute is defined, the containers created by this element are added to a bean with this name, of type
`Collection<SimpleMessageListenerContainer`.
You can iterate over this group to start/stop containers.

===== Class-Level @RabbitListener

The `@RabbitListener` annotation can now be applied at the class level.
Together with the new `@RabbitHandler` method annotation, this allows the handler method to be selected based on payload
type. See <<annotation-method-selection>> for more information.

===== SimpleMessageListenerContainer: BackOff support

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` can now be supplied with a `BackOff` instance for `consumer` startup recovery.
See <<containerAttributes>> for more information.

===== Channel Close Logging

A mechanism to control the log levels of channel closure has been introduced.
See <<channel-close-logging>>.

===== Application Events

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` now emits application events when consumers fail.
See <<consumer-events>> for more information.

===== Consumer Tag Configuration

Previously, the consumer tags for asynchronous consumers were generated by the broker.
With this release, it is now possible to supply a naming strategy to the listener container.
See <<consumerTags>>.

===== MessageListenerAdapter

The `MessageListenerAdapter` now supports a map of queue names (or consumer tags) to method names, to determine
which delegate method to call based on the queue the message was received from.

===== LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory

A new connection factory that connects to the node in a cluster where a mirrored queue actually resides.

See <<queue-affinity>>.

===== Anonymous Queue Naming

Starting with _version 1.5.3_, you can now control how `AnonymousQueue` names are generated.
See <<anonymous-queue>> for more information.

==== Changes in 1.4 Since 1.3

===== @RabbitListener Annotation

POJO listeners can be annotated with `@RabbitListener`, enabled by `@EnableRabbit` or `<rabbit:annotation-driven />`.
Spring Framework 4.1 is required for this feature.
See <<async-annotation-driven>> for more information.

===== RabbitMessagingTemplate

A new `RabbitMessagingTemplate` is provided to allow users to interact with RabbitMQ using `spring-messaging` `Message`s.
It uses the `RabbitTemplate` internally which can be configured as normal.
Spring Framework 4.1 is required for this feature.
See <<template-messaging>> for more information.

===== Listener Container 'Missing Queues Fatal' Attribute

1.3.5 introduced the `missingQueuesFatal` property on the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`.
This is now available on the listener container namespace element.
See <<containerAttributes>>.

===== RabbitTemplate 'ConfirmCallback' Interface

The `confirm` method on this interface has an additional parameter `cause`.
When available, this parameter will contain the reason for a negative acknowledgement (nack).
See <<template-confirms>>.

===== RabbitConnectionFactoryBean

A factory bean is now provided to create the underlying RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` used by the `CachingConnectionFactory`.
This enables configuration of SSL options using Spring's dependency injection.
See <<connection-factory>>.

===== CachingConnectionFactory

The `CachingConnectionFactory` now allows the `connectionTimeout` to be set as a property or as an attribute in the namespace.
It sets the property on the underlying RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` See <<connection-factory>>.

===== Log Appender

The Logback `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.logback.AmqpAppender` has been introduced.
It provides similar options like `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.log4j.AmqpAppender`.
For more info see JavaDocs of these classes.

The Log4j `AmqpAppender` now supports the `deliveryMode` property (`PERSISTENT` or `NON_PERSISTENT`, default: `PERSISTENT`).
Previously, all log4j messages were PERSISTENT.

The appender also supports modification of the `Message` before sending - allowing, for example, the addition of custom headers.
Subclasses should override the `postProcessMessageBeforeSend()`.

===== Listener Queues

The listener container now, by default, redeclares any missing queues during startup.
A new `auto-declare` attribute has been added to the `<rabbit:listener-container>` to prevent these redeclarations.
See <<lc-auto-delete>>.

===== RabbitTemplate: mandatory and connectionFactorySelector Expressions

The `mandatoryExpression` and `sendConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` and `receiveConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` SpEL `Expression`s properties have been added to the `RabbitTemplate`.
The `mandatoryExpression` is used to evaluate a `mandatory` boolean value against each request message, when a `ReturnCallback` is in use.
See <<template-confirms>>.
The `sendConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` and `receiveConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` are used when an `AbstractRoutingConnectionFactory` is provided, to determine the `lookupKey` for the target `ConnectionFactory` at runtime on each AMQP protocol interaction operation.
See <<routing-connection-factory>>.

===== Listeners and the Routing Connection Factory

A `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` can be configured with a routing connection factory to enable connection selection based on the queue names.
See <<routing-connection-factory>>.

===== RabbitTemplate: RecoveryCallback option

The `recoveryCallback` property has been added to be used in the `retryTemplate.execute()`.
See <<template-retry>>.

===== MessageConversionException

This exception is now a subclass of `AmqpException`; if you have code like the following:

[source,java]
----
try {
    template.convertAndSend("foo", "bar", "baz");
}
catch (AmqpException e) {
	...
}
catch (MessageConversionException e) {
	...
}
----

The second catch block will no longer be reachable and needs to be moved above the catch-all `AmqpException` catch block.

===== RabbitMQ 3.4 Compatibility

Spring AMQP is now compatible with the *RabbitMQ 3.4*, including direct reply-to; see <<compatibility>> and <<direct-reply-to>> for more information.

===== ContentTypeDelegatingMessageConverter

The `ContentTypeDelegatingMessageConverter` has been introduced to select the `MessageConverter` to use, based on the `contentType` property in the `MessageProperties`.
See <<message-converters>> for more information.

==== Changes in 1.3 Since 1.2

===== Listener Concurrency

The listener container now supports dynamic scaling of the number of consumers based on workload, or the concurrency can be programmatically changed without stopping the container.
See <<listener-concurrency>>.

===== Listener Queues

The listener container now permits the queue(s) on which it is listening to be modified at runtime.
Also, the container will now start if at least one of its configured queues is available for use.
See <<listener-queues>>

This listener container will now redeclare any auto-delete queues during startup.
See <<lc-auto-delete>>.

===== Consumer Priority

The listener container now supports consumer arguments, allowing the `x-priority` argument to be set.
See <<consumer-priority>>.

===== Exclusive Consumer

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` can now be configured with a single `exclusive` consumer, preventing other consumers from listening to the queue.
See <<exclusive-consumer>>.

===== Rabbit Admin

It is now possible to have the Broker generate the queue name, regardless of durable, autoDelete and exclusive settings.
See <<broker-configuration>>.

===== Direct Exchange Binding

Previously, omitting the `key` attribute from a `binding` element of a `direct-exchange` configuration caused the queue or exchange to be bound with an empty string as the routing key.
Now it is bound with the the name of the provided `Queue` or `Exchange`.
Users wishing to bind with an empty string routing key need to specify `key=""`.

===== AMQP Template

The `AmqpTemplate` now provides several synchronous `receiveAndReply` methods.
These are implemented by the `RabbitTemplate`.
For more information see <<receiving-messages>>.

The `RabbitTemplate` now supports configuring a `RetryTemplate` to attempt retries (with optional back off policy) for when the broker is not available.
For more information see <<template-retry>>.

===== Caching Connection Factory

The caching connection factory can now be configured to cache `Connection`s and their `Channel`s instead of using a single connection and caching just `Channel`s.
See <<connections>>.

===== Binding Arguments

The `<exchange>`'s `<binding>` now supports parsing of the `<binding-arguments>` sub-element.
The `<headers-exchange>`'s `<binding>` now can be configured with a `key/value` attribute pair (to match on a single header) or with a `<binding-arguments>` sub-element, allowing matching on multiple headers; these options are mutually exclusive.
See <<headers-exchange>>.

===== Routing Connection Factory

A new `SimpleRoutingConnectionFactory` has been introduced, to allow configuration of `ConnectionFactories` mapping to determine the target `ConnectionFactory` to use at runtime.
See <<routing-connection-factory>>.

===== MessageBuilder and MessagePropertiesBuilder

"Fluent APIs" for building messages and/or message properties is now provided.
See <<message-builder>>.

===== RetryInterceptorBuilder

A "Fluent API" for building listener container retry interceptors is now provided.
See <<retry>>.

===== RepublishMessageRecoverer

This new `MessageRecoverer` is provided to allow publishing a failed message to another queue (including stack trace information in the header) when retries are exhausted.
See <<async-listeners>>.

===== Default Error Handler (Since 1.3.2)

A default `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` has been added to the listener container.
This error handler detects message conversion problems (which are fatal) and instructs the container to reject the message to prevent the broker from continually redelivering the unconvertible message.
See <<exception-handling>>.

===== Listener Container 'missingQueuesFatal` Property (Since 1.3.5)

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` now has a property `missingQueuesFatal` (default `true`).
Previously, missing queues were always fatal.
See <<containerAttributes>>.

==== Changes to 1.2 Since 1.1

===== RabbitMQ Version

Spring AMQP now using RabbitMQ 3.1.x by default (but retains compatibility with earlier versions).
Certain deprecations have been added for features no longer supported by RabbitMQ 3.1.x - federated exchanges and the `immediate` property on the `RabbitTemplate`.

===== Rabbit Admin

The `RabbitAdmin` now provides an option to allow exchange, queue, and binding declarations to continue when a declaration fails.
Previously, all declarations stopped on a failure.
By setting `ignore-declaration-exceptions`, such exceptions are logged (WARN), but further declarations continue.
An example where this might be useful is when a queue declaration fails because of a slightly different `ttl` setting would normally stop other declarations from proceeding.

The `RabbitAdmin` now provides an additional method `getQueueProperties()`.
This can be used to determine if a queue exists on the broker (returns null for a non-existent queue).
In addition, the current number of messages in the queue, as well as the current number of consumers is returned.

===== Rabbit Template

Previously, when using the `...sendAndReceive()` methods were used with a fixed reply queue, two custom headers were used for correlation data and to retain/restore reply queue information.
With this release, the standard message property `correlationId` is used by default, although the user can specifiy a custom property to use instead.
In addition, nested `replyTo` information is now retained internally in the template, instead of using a custom header.

The `immediate` property is deprecated; users must not set this property when using RabbitMQ 3.0.x or greater.

===== JSON Message Converters

A Jackson 2.x `MessageConverter` is now provided, along with the existing converter that uses Jackson 1.x.

===== Automatic Declaration of Queues, etc

Previously, when declaring queues, exchanges and bindings, it was not possible to define which connection factory was used for the declarations, each `RabbitAdmin` would declare all components using its connection.

Starting with this release, it is now possible to limit declarations to specific `RabbitAdmin` instances.
See <<conditional-declaration>>.

===== AMQP Remoting

Facilities are now provided for using Spring Remoting techniques, using AMQP as the transport for the RPC calls.
For more information see <<remoting>>

===== Requested Heart Beats

Several users have asked for the underlying client connection factory's `requestedHeartBeats` property to be exposed on the Spring AMQP `CachingConnectionFactory`.
This is now available; previously, it was necessary to configure the AMQP client factory as a separate bean and provide a reference to it in the `CachingConnectionFactory`.

==== Changes to 1.1 Since 1.0

===== General

Spring-AMQP is now built using gradle.

Adds support for publisher confirms and returns.

Adds support for HA queues, and broker failover.

Adds support for Dead Letter Exchanges/Dead Letter Queues.

===== AMQP Log4j Appender

Adds an option to support adding a message id to logged messages.

Adds an option to allow the specification of a `Charset` name to be used when converting `String`s to `byte[]`.
