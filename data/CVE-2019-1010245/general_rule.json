    "general_rule": "Rule: Expand Input Validation for Improved Security and Robustness\n\n1. Type of Improvement:\n   Enhance input validation by expanding the set of characters considered invalid or potentially harmful in user-provided data.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   - Increases security by reducing the risk of injection attacks or malformed input\n   - Improves system stability by preventing unexpected behavior caused by special characters\n   - Enhances data consistency by standardizing input format\n\n3. Identifying Similar Opportunities:\n   - Review functions that process user input, especially those used for identifiers, file names, or database queries\n   - Look for existing input validation logic that may be incomplete or overly permissive\n   - Consider all potential input sources, including API endpoints, form submissions, and configuration files\n\n4. General Application:\n   - Analyze the context of the input and determine which characters are truly necessary\n   - Create a whitelist of allowed characters rather than a blacklist of disallowed ones\n   - Use regular expressions or character set operations to perform thorough validation\n   - Implement consistent input sanitization across the entire application\n   - Document the allowed character set clearly for developers and users\n   - Consider the performance impact of more extensive validation, especially for high-volume operations"
